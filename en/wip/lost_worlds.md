## Setting Expansion: Realms Beyond Time

The lost worlds of *Pulp Adventures* exist in the forgotten corners of our planet—places where the normal rules of civilization, evolution, and time itself seem suspended. These are realms where dinosaurs still roam, where ancient civilizations have preserved their secrets for millennia, and where the very landscape holds wonders that challenge everything we think we know about our world.

### The Nature of Lost Worlds

Lost worlds in the pulp tradition are not merely remote locations—they are pockets of impossibility where different eras of Earth's history have been preserved like insects in amber. These realms exist due to extraordinary circumstances: geological isolation, mystical forces, temporal anomalies, or the intervention of advanced ancient sciences.

**Geographic Isolation**: Many lost worlds exist in regions so remote and treacherous that they have remained untouched by the outside world. Hidden valleys in mountain ranges, plateaus surrounded by unscalable cliffs, and islands shrouded in perpetual mists all serve as natural barriers that preserve these prehistoric sanctuaries.

**Temporal Displacement**: Some lost worlds exist in bubbles of altered time, where the flow of centuries has been slowed, stopped, or even reversed. Ancient rituals, cosmic phenomena, or advanced technologies from vanished civilizations may be responsible for these temporal anomalies.

**Evolutionary Refugia**: Certain lost worlds represent evolutionary dead ends—places where species that should have gone extinct millions of years ago continue to thrive. These may be environments so stable and isolated that they never experienced the catastrophes that drove their inhabitants to extinction elsewhere.

**Ancient Guardianship**: Many lost worlds are actively preserved by their inhabitants—whether human survivors of ancient civilizations, evolved species with their own agendas, or mystical guardians who understand the importance of maintaining these reservations of the past.

### Primary Lost World Environments

#### Prehistoric Valleys

Hidden valleys represent the most classic form of lost world, offering complete ecosystems preserved from prehistory. These locations are typically accessed through narrow gorges, hidden cave systems, or treacherous mountain passes that have deterred exploration for millennia.

**The Valley of Giants**: A vast depression surrounded by towering cliffs, where massive herbivorous dinosaurs graze on primitive conifers and tree ferns. The valley floor is crossed by a network of rivers fed by thundering waterfalls that cascade from the rim. Volcanic activity provides the geothermal heat that maintains the valley's tropical climate despite its high-altitude location.

**The Carnivore Canyons**: A series of interconnected gorges where pack-hunting theropods have evolved specialized hunting strategies. The narrow confines force prey into ambush zones, while the vertical nature of the terrain has led to the evolution of climbing predators. Ancient cave paintings suggest human inhabitants once lived here, developing unique hunting techniques to survive alongside these apex predators.

**The Swamp of First Waters**: A primordial wetland where the earliest forms of life still flourish. Giant arthropods patrol the shallow waters, while primitive amphibians that predate true reptiles hunt in the muddy shallows. The very air shimmers with prehistoric humidity, and strange phosphorescent organisms create an otherworldly illumination at night.

#### Hollow Earth Realms

Beneath the surface of our planet lie vast cavern systems and underground worlds that follow their own rules of physics and biology. These subterranean realms often feature their own sources of light—whether through bioluminescent organisms, reflective crystal formations, or mysterious energy sources.

**The Crystal Caverns of Agartha**: A underground realm illuminated by massive crystal formations that capture and amplify light from unknown sources. The crystals create a rainbow spectrum that supports photosynthetic plants in impossible colors. Ancient ruins suggest this was once a thriving civilization that mastered the harmony between geology and biology.

**The Underground Sea**: A vast subterranean ocean complete with its own weather systems, where prehistoric marine reptiles patrol waters that have never seen sunlight. Islands of volcanic rock provide nesting grounds for flying reptiles that have evolved to navigate in perpetual twilight. The sound of waves echoing through limestone chambers creates an otherworldly symphony.

**The Mushroom Forest**: A massive cavern system where fungal organisms have grown to tree-like proportions, creating a forest of towering mushrooms that glow with bioluminescent patterns. Strange creatures that blur the line between plant and animal move through this fungal ecosystem, while spore clouds create natural barriers and mysterious atmospheric effects.

#### Time-Lost Islands

Islands that exist out of phase with normal time and space, where different historical periods may coexist or where evolution has been accelerated, slowed, or diverted along impossible paths.

**The Isle of Eternal Twilight**: An island where the sun never fully rises or sets, trapped in permanent golden hour. This unique lighting has created an ecosystem of creatures adapted to perpetual dawn conditions. Ancient observatories on the highest peaks suggest the island's founders deliberately manipulated celestial mechanics to achieve this effect.

**Evolution's Laboratory**: An island where the normal pace of evolution has been accelerated a thousandfold, creating a constantly shifting ecosystem where species emerge, evolve, and sometimes go extinct within seasons. Bizarre hybrid creatures represent evolutionary experiments that would normally take millions of years to develop.

**The Fractured Isle**: An island where different regions exist in different time periods. Explorers might walk from a Jurassic jungle directly into a Paleozoic swamp, or find themselves in a future where humanity has long vanished. The boundaries between these temporal zones are marked by shimmering distortions in the air.

#### Underground Civilizations

Hidden beneath the earth, ancient human societies have not only survived but flourished, developing technologies and cultures in complete isolation from the surface world.

**The Radium Cities**: Deep underground complexes powered by naturally occurring radioactive deposits that the inhabitants have learned to harness safely. These civilizations have developed glowing technologies and architectural marvels that seem to defy physics, all while remaining completely isolated from surface developments.

**The Tribe of Echoes**: A civilization that has evolved in vast acoustic chambers, developing a culture based entirely around sound and vibration. They communicate through complex musical languages and have developed technologies that use harmonic resonance to carve stone and manipulate their environment.

**The Descendants of Atlantis**: Survivors of the legendary lost continent who retreated underground when their homeland sank. They maintain ancient knowledge and technologies that surface dwellers have lost, but their isolation has also led to cultural stagnation and mysterious degenerative changes.

### Environmental Hazards and Survival Challenges

Lost worlds present unique dangers that go far beyond simple combat encounters. The very environment becomes an active participant in the adventure, constantly testing the explorer's adaptability and resourcefulness.

#### Atmospheric Anomalies

**Prehistoric Air Density**: Many lost worlds have atmospheric compositions different from the modern surface, often with higher oxygen content that can cause euphoria or disorientation in surface dwellers, while also supporting the larger body sizes typical of prehistoric fauna.

**Toxic Spore Clouds**: Fungal organisms and primitive plants may release clouds of spores that can cause hallucinations, respiratory distress, or even temporary paralysis. Some spores may have beneficial effects, providing enhanced strength or sensory acuity.

**Magnetic Interference**: Certain lost worlds exist in areas of intense magnetic activity that renders compasses useless and can cause disorientation. Some areas may even reverse magnetic polarity periodically, creating navigation nightmares.

#### Geological Instability

**Volcanic Activity**: Many lost worlds are maintained by geothermal energy, creating landscapes of active volcanoes, hot springs, and geysers. While these provide the energy that sustains these ecosystems, they also create constant dangers from eruptions, poisonous gases, and unstable ground.

**Temporal Earthquakes**: In regions where time flows differently, seismic activity may affect the flow of time itself, creating "temporal quakes" where explorers might experience time loops, rapid aging, or glimpses of the past or future.

**Living Geology**: Some lost worlds feature geological formations that seem almost alive—crystal formations that grow rapidly, caves that shift their layouts, or rock formations that respond to sound or touch.

#### Biological Hazards

**Prehistoric Diseases**: Bacteria and viruses that have been extinct on the surface for millions of years may still thrive in lost worlds, presenting diseases for which modern immunity provides no protection.

**Parasitic Ecosystems**: Some lost world organisms have evolved to parasitize any foreign organisms that enter their domain, from small creatures that burrow under the skin to plant spores that attempt to convert intruders into part of the local ecosystem.

**Predatory Plants**: Vegetation that has evolved in the absence of large herbivores may have developed aggressive predatory behaviors, from mobile vines that hunt prey to flower fields that release narcotic pollens to subdue victims.

### The Temporal Flow of Lost Worlds

Time itself behaves differently in lost worlds, and understanding these temporal mechanics is crucial for survival and successful exploration.

#### Accelerated Evolution Zones

Areas where evolutionary processes occur at an observable pace, allowing explorers to witness adaptation and speciation in real time. These zones are often marked by shimmering distortions in the air and may be caused by unknown energy sources or temporal anomalies.

#### Stasis Fields

Regions where time flows so slowly that they serve as natural preservation chambers. Ancient ruins remain perfectly intact, but explorers who enter these fields risk becoming trapped in temporal amber, aging years while the outside world advances only minutes.

#### Temporal Echoes

Locations where past events continue to replay like recordings, creating ghostly reenactments of historical moments. These echoes can provide valuable information about the history of the lost world, but they can also be dangerous if they involve violent or catastrophic events.

#### Chronological Instabilities

Areas where the flow of time is unpredictable, sometimes moving forward, sometimes backward, sometimes stopping entirely. These instabilities can scatter an expedition across different time periods or create situations where cause and effect become unreliable.

### Expansion of Exploration Mechanics

Building on the existing exploration rules from *Pulp Adventures*, lost worlds require additional considerations for survival and discovery.

#### Resource Management in Lost Worlds

Traditional supplies may prove inadequate or even dangerous in lost world environments. Water purification tablets might not work against prehistoric microorganisms, while modern medicines could have unexpected effects on explorers exposed to ancient atmospheric conditions.

**Adaptation Checks**: When first entering a lost world, characters may need to make Oracle rolls to determine how well they adapt to the unique environmental conditions. Failure might result in temporary Frailty tags like "Atmospheric Sickness" or "Temporal Disorientation."

**Local Resources**: Lost worlds often provide unique resources that can aid or hinder exploration. Luminescent fungi might serve as natural light sources, while certain plants could provide medicine or nutrition. However, distinguishing beneficial resources from dangerous ones requires careful observation and sometimes dangerous experimentation.

#### Discovery Mechanics

Lost worlds are treasure troves of scientific discovery, ancient artifacts, and evolutionary marvels. The exploration system should reflect the excitement of uncovering these wonders while maintaining the danger inherent in poking around places that time forgot.

**Revelation Moments**: Major discoveries in lost worlds should feel momentous. When explorers encounter their first living dinosaur, discover evidence of an unknown civilization, or witness impossible evolutionary adaptations, these moments deserve special narrative attention and possibly mechanical benefits.

**Knowledge as Currency**: Information and specimens discovered in lost worlds are often more valuable than traditional treasure. Maps of safe routes, behavioral observations of dangerous creatures, or samples of unique organisms can become crucial resources for future expeditions.

#### Navigation in Impossible Terrains

Lost worlds often feature landscapes that defy conventional navigation techniques. Magnetic anomalies, temporal distortions, and the absence of familiar celestial reference points create unique navigation challenges.

**Landmark Navigation**: In environments where compasses fail and stars may be invisible, explorers must rely on unique geological features, distinctive flora, or behavioral patterns of local fauna to maintain their bearings.

**Sound Mapping**: In underground lost worlds or dense prehistoric forests, sound may become the primary navigation tool. Learning to interpret the acoustic signatures of different environments—the echo patterns of cave systems or the territorial calls of dangerous predators—becomes essential for survival.

## Specialized Character Creation

Lost world expeditions require a different breed of adventurer than the typical pulp hero. While maintaining compatibility with *Pulp Adventures* character creation, these specialized options reflect the unique challenges of exploring realms where normal rules don't apply and ancient secrets wait to be discovered.

### New Character Concepts

## Adventure Generation

Lost world adventures require a different approach to scenario generation, focusing on discovery, adaptation, and the gradual revelation of impossible truths. These procedures help create emerging narratives that capture the wonder and terror of venturing into realms where humanity was never meant to tread.

### Lost World-Specific Adventure Hooks

Unlike traditional pulp adventures that might focus on treasure hunting or espionage, lost world scenarios center around exploration, survival, and the revelation of hidden knowledge. These hooks provide starting points for expeditions into the unknown.

#### The Call to Adventure

Lost world adventures typically begin with one of several classic motivations that draw explorers into danger despite obvious risks.

**The Scientific Expedition**: A research team requires guides, security, or additional expertise for an expedition to investigate anomalous findings. Fossil discoveries that challenge evolution theory, geological surveys that reveal impossible formations, or astronomical observations that suggest unknown physics all provide compelling reasons to venture into dangerous territory.

**The Rescue Mission**: Previous expeditions have vanished or sent distress signals from remote locations. Family members, institutions, or governments offer substantial rewards for information about missing persons or the recovery of valuable research data.

**The Accidental Discovery**: Characters stumble upon evidence of lost worlds during routine activities. A mining operation breaks through into vast underground caverns, a volcanic eruption reveals ancient ruins, or extreme weather exposes landscapes that shouldn't exist.

**The Hereditary Quest**: Characters inherit maps, journals, or artifacts that point toward family secrets hidden in remote locations. Ancestral obligations, mysterious legacies, or cryptic final messages drive exploration into unknown territories.

**The Competing Expedition**: Rivals are mounting their own expeditions to locations of mutual interest. The race to be first, to claim priority for discoveries, or to prevent dangerous knowledge from falling into wrong hands motivates rapid and sometimes reckless exploration.

#### Discovery Cascade System

Lost world adventures work best when each revelation leads naturally to the next, creating a cascade of discoveries that gradually reveals the full scope of the hidden realm.

**Initial Anomaly**: The adventure begins with a single piece of evidence that suggests something unusual but not yet impossible. Strange fossils, unusual geological formations, or inconsistent dating of archaeological finds.

**Threshold Crossing**: Characters must overcome significant obstacles to reach the lost world itself. This creates commitment to the expedition and emphasizes the isolation and danger of their destination.

**First Contact**: The initial encounter with the impossible—living dinosaurs, ancient humans, or obviously artificial landscapes. This moment should be dramatic and establish the new reality of the environment.

**Systematic Exploration**: Characters begin to understand the scope and nature of the lost world, discovering its unique ecology, geography, and any intelligent inhabitants.

**Deep Mystery**: Investigation reveals underlying questions about how and why the lost world exists, often involving ancient technologies, temporal anomalies, or cosmic forces.

**Ultimate Revelation**: The final discovery that explains the nature of the lost world and often has implications extending far beyond the immediate location.

#### Expedition Framework Generation

| D6 | Primary Motivation | Secondary Complication | Urgency Factor |
|----|-------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| 1  | Scientific Research | Rival Expedition | Limited Time Window |
| 2  | Rescue Mission | Equipment Failure | Environmental Catastrophe |

|| 4  | Archaeological Discovery | Government Interference | Natural Disaster Threat |
| 5  | Personal Quest | Financial Constraints | Temporal Anomaly |
| 6  | Accidental Encounter | Technological Malfunction | Evolutionary Pressure |

### Procedures for Generating Lost Civilizations

Lost civilizations in pulp adventures represent alternate paths of human development—societies that discovered different solutions to fundamental problems or adapted to environments that changed the very nature of humanity itself.

#### Civilization Development Framework

**Temporal Origin**: When did this civilization develop? Are they descendants of a known historical culture, survivors from a catastrophic period, or something that evolved independently in isolation?

**Environmental Adaptation**: How did their environment shape their development? Underground civilizations develop different technologies than those in temporal bubbles or isolated valleys.

**Knowledge Focus**: What areas of understanding did they prioritize? Some civilizations might master biology while remaining primitive in metallurgy, others might achieve temporal manipulation while never developing agriculture.

**Current Status**: Are they thriving, declining, recently extinct, or transformed into something no longer recognizably human?
