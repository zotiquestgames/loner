# Loner Cozy Fantasy

***Loner Cozy Fantasy*** is a solo tabletop RPG adventure set in a warm realm of gentle magic, small communities, and everyday wonders.

This minimalist Solo Role Playing Game is designed to be a low-stakes, comforting journey focused on personal growth, found family, and soft, local challenges.

## Introduction

***Loner Cozy Fantasy*** follows the following design principles:

1. **Portable**: To play, you will need a few common six-sided dice and writing materials. Anything else is optional and not essential.
2. **Rules-Light**: The game relies on a few rules and only one solving mechanic, easy to learn and eventually memorize.
3. **Tag-based**: Characters and situations are defined only by qualitative descriptors and no quantitative characteristics.

With a focus on quick resolutions, **Loner Cozy Fantasy** throws you into the heart of small, heartwarming adventures. Your character will be defined by thematic tags, such as *“Gentle Herbalist”*, *“Wandering Baker”*, or *“Timid Apprentice Mage”*.

### What is a Role-Playing Game (RPG)?
A role-playing game (RPG) is a type of game in which players assume the roles of fictional characters and act out their actions and decisions within a narrative or imaginary setting. The outcome of these actions and decisions is often determined by a set of rules and game mechanics, such as dice rolls or qualitative descriptors. Players may also collaborate to create a shared story or narrative through their characters' actions and interactions.

### What is a Solo RPG?

In a solo RPG, a single player takes on the roles of one or more characters while also managing some elements of the game world. These games typically involve the use of a rule system and game mechanics to determine the outcome of actions taken by the player-controlled characters. 
Unlike a gamebook (such as *Fighting Fantasy*, *Lone Wolf*, or *Tunnels & Trolls*), a solo RPG is not a form of interactive, forked narrative in which outcomes are predetermined and limited by the author’s choices.

Through the interaction of the player, oracle, tools, and prompts, the character’s actions will build an **emergent narrative** within whose boundaries anything can be attempted, without predetermined limits.

## What is Cozy Fantasy?

Cozy Fantasy is a genre that embraces warmth, wonder, and a sense of belonging. Instead of high-stakes battles or world-ending catastrophes, it focuses on **small, meaningful adventures**—solving personal dilemmas, helping a community, or discovering magic in the everyday.

It’s about **comfort and connection**, where conflicts are resolved with wit, kindness, and cleverness rather than brute force. The setting is often filled with **inviting villages, enchanted forests, and magical workshops**, where characters are more likely to be bakers, herbalists, or librarians than warriors or thieves.

Here are some hallmarks of Cozy Fantasy:

- **Low-Stakes Conflicts:** Problems might involve fixing a broken teapot that whispers secrets, finding a lost cat with a mischievous streak, or helping a ghost move on—not defeating an evil overlord.
- **A Comforting Atmosphere:** The world is warm and inviting, with rustic cottages, magical bakeries, and cozy firesides where friends gather to share stories.
- **Gentle Magic:** Spells don’t destroy; they heal, protect, and create. Enchanted quilts bring good dreams, tea blends soothe troubled minds, and handwritten letters carry a bit of the sender’s heart.
- **Character-Driven Stories:** Instead of epic quests, Cozy Fantasy focuses on **relationships, self-discovery, and community-building**. Found families, lifelong friendships, and personal growth take center stage.
- **A Slice of Everyday Magic:** Simple pleasures—freshly baked bread, a perfectly brewed cup of tea, or a kind word—hold as much narrative weight as any grand adventure.

If you love the idea of **wandering into a sleepy town, running a magical café, or unraveling tiny mysteries between cups of warm cider**, then *Loner Cozy Fantasy* is for you. Here, every small moment matters, and even the most ordinary day can hold a bit of magic.

### Safety Tools
You will play alone, but be sure to play in an environment that is comfortable for you, without overexerting yourself, and reserve the option to stop as soon as you feel uncomfortable for any reason, physical or emotional. Don't be afraid to tackle new themes, but do so in full awareness of your boundaries.

### Minimum Requirements
To play *Loner Cozy Fantasy*, you will need:
- **4 six-sided dice** (also known as d6s): two pairs of different colors
- **Paper and writing tools**: At least a sheet of scrap paper and a pencil, but index cards or sticky notes are a fine addition.
- **Character sheet**: You may use the provided sheet at the back or a simple index card.
- **Notebook**: *Loner Cozy Fantasy* is not a solo journaling game; you can easily play it in the "theater of the mind." However, keeping track of your game in a journal can enhance your experience if you feel the need!

## Setting Introduction

Welcome to **Everhollow**, a world where magic lingers in the quiet corners of life, woven into the fabric of everyday routines. It is a place of **small villages, hidden wonders, and gentle mysteries**, where each season brings its own enchantments and every cup of tea carries a whisper of magic.

The lands of Everhollow are not ruled by mighty empires or plagued by dark lords. Instead, they are **tended by storytellers, bakers, apothecaries, and wanderers**—people who cherish the slow beauty of life. Here, adventure is not about slaying dragons but about **helping a neighbor, tending to a stubborn magical garden, or uncovering the lost recipes of a centuries-old bakery**.

### A World of Small Wonders

- **Villages and Hamlets:** Instead of grand cities, Everhollow is dotted with **quaint villages and cozy hamlets**, each with its own unique traditions, seasonal festivals, and charming eccentricities. Whether it’s the candlelit streets of **Brindlewick**, the floating herbal market of **Mossmere**, or the valley orchards of **Cindergrove**, every place has a story.
- **Gentle Magic:** Magic is a **part of daily life**, subtle yet powerful. It is found in **enchanted ink that writes secret messages, gardens that grow best when sung to, and bakeries where the scent of cinnamon can heal a broken heart**.
- **The Four Seasons:** The world follows the gentle rhythm of the seasons, each bringing **new joys and quiet challenges**. Autumn is rich with pumpkin harvests and crackling hearths; winter brings candlelit evenings and snow-dusted rooftops. Spring hums with the buzz of new growth, while summer carries the scent of wildflowers and long twilight gatherings.

### A Place of Stories, Not War

Everhollow is not a place of war or conquest. Conflicts here are **personal, heartfelt, and often resolved through kindness, understanding, or a touch of magic**. Whether it’s mending a friendship, helping a spirit find peace, or brewing the perfect cup of calming tea for an anxious traveler, **every problem has a solution that doesn’t require a sword**.

### What Adventures Await?

- Restoring a forgotten **herbal garden**, where each plant holds a different kind of magic.
- Solving the mystery of the **wandering lighthouse**, which appears in a different village each month.
- Helping a **mischievous talking cat** find its lost owner (or perhaps its lost purpose).
- Weaving a cloak of **midnight starlight** for a traveler who wishes to walk unseen.
- Learning the **secrets of an ancient recipe** that was once baked only on the longest night of the year.

In *Loner Cozy Fantasy*, **adventure is not about saving the world—it’s about finding joy in the little moments, forging friendships, and embracing the everyday magic that makes life special**.

## Timeline of Everhollow

The history of Everhollow is not marked by wars or empires but by the ebb and flow of everyday magic, community traditions, and the mysteries of nature. Time here is measured in the **turn of seasons, the stories passed down, and the slow, steady rhythms of life**.

### **The Age of First Hearths (Time Unknown - Long Ago)**
- Before history was recorded, people settled in the valleys, forests, and hilltops, drawn by the land’s quiet magic.
- The first villages formed around natural wonders—**a well that always gave warm water, an orchard where the trees whispered secrets, a lake that never froze even in winter**.
- Magic was not studied but simply known, a part of daily life like the rising sun and the evening stars.

### **The Age of Lanterns (Long Ago - Generations Past)**
- Travelers and wandering artisans spread across the land, bringing tales, crafts, and gentle enchantments.
- The great **Lantern Festivals** began, marking the seasons with light, music, and feasts.
- Many of the traditions still practiced today—**bread-blessing ceremonies, the art of ink-whispering, and the first talking cats**—were established in this time.
- The first *Wayfarers’ Lodges* appeared, cozy havens for those who wished to wander but always have a home to return to.

### **The Age of Gathering Tales (Generations Past - A Few Centuries Ago)**
- The world grew richer in stories as villages began keeping **Great Storybooks**, bound collections of myths, recipes, and memories.
- Magic found new forms—bakers who could weave emotions into pies, tailors who embroidered dreams into fabric, scribes who could trap a melody inside a page.
- The wandering library known as the **Everbook Caravan** first appeared, moving from town to town, never in the same place twice.

### **The Age of the Unraveling Mist (A Few Centuries Ago - A Lifetime Ago)**
- A strange fog drifted across Everhollow, obscuring some places and revealing others.
- Hidden **groves, cottages, and long-lost pathways** reappeared, as if waiting for the right moment to be found.
- Some say the mist was not a danger but a reminder—that the world still holds mysteries worth uncovering.

### **The Present Age: The Age of Quiet Wonders (Now)**
- The land has settled into **a gentle harmony**, with each village and town nurturing its own traditions and small magics.
- Magic is **woven into daily life**, but some still seek out the forgotten places left behind by the mist.
- The greatest adventures are not in battles but in **friendships, discoveries, and small acts of kindness**.
- Every season brings new mysteries: a **shop that wasn’t there yesterday, a star that sings in the night, an old letter found in the roots of an ancient tree**.

## Characters  

In *Loner Cozy Fantasy*, characters are **ordinary people with extraordinary hearts**, drawn into small but meaningful adventures. Instead of warriors and rogues, you’ll step into the shoes of **herbalists, apprentice magicians, traveling storytellers, and kindly shopkeepers**—people who bring warmth and wonder to the world around them.  

Your journey will not be about slaying dragons or toppling kingdoms, but about **building friendships, unraveling gentle mysteries, and making a difference in the lives of those around you**. Whether it’s a baker whose pastries hold emotions, a wandering musician who hears the whispers of the wind, or a bookbinder who stitches forgotten stories back into the world, every character has a place in the quiet magic of Everhollow.  

### Everything is a Character!  

In *Loner Cozy Fantasy*, Non-Playing Characters (NPCs), Foes, Organizations, Monsters, and even significant objects—like a sentient teapot or a wandering house—are treated as characters, each with their own **tags and qualities**.  

Your Protagonist is described by a set of fixed traits:  

- **Name**: The name should be whimsical and fitting for a world of cozy magic.  
- **Concept**: A concise description of the character’s profession, background, or identity. Examples: *"Kindly Bookbinder"*, *"Wandering Candle-Mage"*, *"Forgetful Potion-Maker"*.  
- **Skills** (x2): Unique abilities that define how the character interacts with the world. *"Good Listener"* is better than *"Smart"*, and *"Cloud-Whisperer"* is better than *"Weather Control"*.  
- **Frailty**: A personal challenge or shortcoming—perhaps a fear, a stubborn streak, or a tendency to get lost in daydreams.  
- **Gear** (x2): Special items the character carries, enchanted or mundane, that hold personal significance. Examples: *"Ever-Warm Tea Kettle"*, *"Lantern That Knows the Way"*.  
- **Goal**: A quiet ambition or dream—perhaps to perfect a recipe, write a story, or uncover a forgotten place.  
- **Motive**: What drives them to pursue this goal? Curiosity, longing, duty, or something else?  
- **Nemesis**: Not always an enemy, but someone (or something) that complicates their journey—perhaps an old rival, a mischievous spirit, or a skeptical town elder.  
- **Luck**: A measure of the character’s ability to avoid misfortune. It applies in Conflicts and resets at the end of each scene. Luck starts and caps at 6.  

These **traits** are described by **tags**—descriptive words or phrases that bring them to life. Even environments and emotional conditions are represented by tags.  

**They are qualitative representations, not numerical values.**

## Rules

*Loner Cozy Fantasy* is a minimalist Solo Role Playing Game designed to be played with only one character (the Protagonist). You'll guide them through the story that will unravel during the game, asking closed questions to an Oracle which will help you overturn your expectations.

Every now and then you will be surprised with an unexpected twist!

### Keep The Action In Motion

A game in *Loner Cozy Fantasy* is a succession of scenes. 
A scene is a unit of time in which a certain action takes place in pursuit of a certain short-term goal. 

In *Loner Cozy Fantasy* at each scene:
1. **Identify what you expect from the scene**. Compared to traits, goal, and motivation determine the Protagonist's action. What might be the reaction of the game world?
2. **Test your expectations**. When you are uncertain (or overconfident) about the reaction to your actions, [ask the Oracle](#consulting-the-oracle) a closed question (answer is Yes or No), considering the tags involved to determine if there is an [Advantage or Disadvantage](#advantage-and-disadvantage).
3. **Interpret the result**. Is the Oracle's answer in line with your expectations? If not, in the context in which the scene takes place, how should an answer that subverts them be considered?

This sequence will come to you naturally after some practice. Use it as a guideline the first few times.

### Consulting the Oracle

When you need to test your expectations you'll ask the Oracle a closed question.

You’ll need 2d6 in one color (**Chance Dice**), and 2d6 in another (**Risk Dice**).

To resolve a closed question, roll one **Chance Die** and one **Risk Die**:
- If the Chance Die is highest, the answer is **Yes**. 
- If the Risk Die is highest, the answer is **No**.
- If both are low (3 or less), add a **but...**. 
- If both are high (4 or more), add an **and...**.
- If both are equal, the answer is **Yes, but...**. Add a point to the **[Twist Counter](#twist-counter)**.


| Dice Value |    Chance Die > Risk Die   | Risk Die > Chance Die |
|:----------:|:--------------------------:|:---------------------:|
|  Both < 4  |         Yes, but...        |       No, but...      |
|  Both > 3  |         Yes, and...        |       No, and...      |
| Mismatched |             Yes            |           No          |
|            |                            |                       |
|    Equal   | Add 1 to the Twist Counter |                       |

### Advantage and Disadvantage

If circumstances or positive tags grant an advantage, add a **Chance Die** to the roll. Otherwise, when hindrances or negative tag cause a disadvantage, add a **Risk Die**. In both cases keep only the higher die of the added type when you check the roll.

Consider tags **intuitively and not quantitatively**, using the context of the situation at play. It is important to keep the flow of play fast and not accounting for advantages and disadvantages numerically!

### Twist Counter

The Twist Counter is a measure of the rising tension in the narrative. At the beginning is set to 0. Every time a double throw (dice are equal) happens, add 1 to the Counter. If the Counter is below three, consider the answer as "**Yes, but...**". Otherwise a **Twist** happens and resets the Counter.

Roll 2d6 and consult the following Twist Table to determine what kind of twist happens. 

| D6 |      Subject       |        Action       |
|:--:|:------------------:|:-------------------:|
|  1 |    A third party   |       Appears       |
|  2 |      The hero      | Alters the location |
|  3 |    An encounter    |    Helps the hero   |
|  4 |  A physical event  |   Hinders the hero  |
|  5 | An emotional event |   Changes the goal  |
|  6 |      An object     |    Ends the scene   |

Interpret the two-word sentence in the context of the current scene. Twists will keep the plot and events going in unexpected ways.

## **Setting Related Rules**

The world of *Loner Cozy Fantasy* is one of warmth, wonder, and personal connections. Instead of battles and grand quests, the game focuses on **helping others, uncovering small mysteries, and finding joy in everyday magic**. The following rules guide how challenges and progress are handled in this setting.

### **The Heart & Hearth System**  
In *Loner Cozy Fantasy*, instead of measuring physical harm or success in battle, we track **Heart (Emotional Well-being)** and **Hearth (Sense of Home & Belonging)**.  

- **Heart** represents a character’s emotional state, motivation, and personal fulfillment.
- **Hearth** represents their connection to places, people, and traditions that make them feel safe.

When challenges arise, instead of taking damage, a character may lose **Heart** (feeling discouraged, lonely, or overwhelmed) or **Hearth** (feeling disconnected or uncertain).  
A character regains **Heart** through **small moments of joy, self-care, and encouragement**.  
A character regains **Hearth** by **spending time with loved ones, engaging in comforting rituals, or finding stability in a place that matters to them**.

#### **How It Works in Play**  
- If a scene is particularly **emotionally challenging**, roll 1d6. On a **1-3**, the character loses **Heart**; on a **4-6**, they find a way to push through.  
- If a scene involves **losing or finding a sense of home**, roll 1d6. On a **1-3**, they feel adrift, losing **Hearth**; on a **4-6**, they reaffirm their place in the world.  
- Restoring **Heart** and **Hearth** should be part of the story—**a warm cup of tea, a heartfelt conversation, or a favorite book on a rainy afternoon** can help recover what was lost.

### **The Comfort Conflict Resolution**  
Since combat is rare in this setting, challenges are often about **persuasion, crafting, problem-solving, or emotional negotiation**. When a major challenge arises:  

1. **Set the Stakes** – What is at risk? (e.g., Someone’s trust, a fragile object, a secret)
2. **Roll as Normal with the Oracle**, but interpret results through a cozy lens:
   - **Yes, and...** → The resolution is even more heartwarming than expected.
   - **Yes...** → The problem is solved, and everyone feels good about it.
   - **Yes, but...** → The problem is solved, but a small misunderstanding remains.
   - **No, but...** → The attempt doesn’t work, but a new path opens up.
   - **No...** → The challenge isn’t resolved, but it isn’t disastrous.
   - **No, and...** → The challenge escalates, but not in a dangerous way—perhaps someone is embarrassed, or a misunderstanding deepens.

### **Kind Deeds & Quiet Magic**  
A character can use small acts of kindness or gentle magic to assist others.  
Whenever a character **helps someone in a meaningful way** (without expectation of reward), roll 1d6:  

- **1-2** → The act is appreciated, but doesn’t have an immediate effect.  
- **3-4** → The act brings comfort, mends a small hurt, or strengthens a relationship.  
- **5-6** → The act creates a lasting change, earning deep gratitude or unexpected good fortune.

### **Mysteries & Whimsy**  
Mysteries in *Loner Cozy Fantasy* are rarely sinister—often, they lead to new friendships, forgotten places, or rediscovered joys.
 The world is filled with **gentle mysteries and small wonders**. When encountering something **unknown, magical, or curious**, roll 1d6:  

- **1-3** → The mystery deepens, raising more questions.  
- **4-5** → A small clue is revealed.  
- **6** → A major insight is gained, or the mystery is delightfully solved.  

### **Seasonal Magic & Traditions**  
Each season brings **its own gentle challenges and opportunities**, shaping the world’s rhythm. The passing of the seasons is an integral part of the world. If a **seasonal event** is happening (like the Lantern Festival, the First Snowfall, or the Gathering of Fireflies), it influences the magic in the air.  

- During **Autumn & Winter**, characters gain advantage when creating **cozy spaces, hosting gatherings, or preserving traditions**.  
- During **Spring & Summer**, they gain advantage when engaging in **exploration, personal growth, or making new connections**.  

## **Magic in Everhollow**  
Magic in *Loner Cozy Fantasy* is not about power or destruction—it is about **enhancing everyday life, bringing comfort, and uncovering small wonders**. It is deeply personal, often tied to traditions, crafts, or natural elements.  

Instead of rigid spell lists, magic is flexible, flowing through **intent, creativity, and storytelling**. The magic system uses an **oracle-based** approach, letting players **discover magic organically** rather than treating it as a fixed set of rules.

You're absolutely right! Instead of adding an entirely separate mechanic for magic resolution, we should **integrate it into the existing oracle system** so that magic remains intuitive, narrative-driven, and seamlessly fits the game’s structure.

### **Revised Magic System: The Whim of Magic**

Magic in Everhollow is not about strict spells or formulas—it is about **intention, connection, and storytelling**. Whether it is infused into **tea-brewing, embroidery, song, or candlelight**, every spell is a small act of wonder.

Whenever a character **attempts to use magic**:

1. **Describe the magic:** How is the character performing it? What do they hope to achieve?
2. **Ask the Oracle:** "Does the spell work as intended?" and roll 2d6 to consult the table.
3. **Interpret the answer:** If the result has a complication (*Yes, but...*, *No, but...*, *No, and...*), roll on the **D66 Unintended Effects Table** for inspiration.
4. **Narrate what happens:** Whether successful or not, every spell **shapes the story** in some way.

| **Oracle Answer** | **Magic Outcome** |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Yes, and...**  | The spell works **perfectly**, and something even more delightful happens. |
| **Yes...**       | The spell works exactly as intended. |
| **Yes, but...**  | The spell works, **but** there is a small unexpected side effect. |

## Conflicts

A *Conflict* is any situation in which opponents clash, attacking, defending, or wearing each other down in order to win.
This applies both in a practical and metaphorical sense. 

So, a Conflict is not only limited to combat (or fighting) in the strict sense but also to competitive situations (such as contests, duels, verbal confrontations, etc.) in which two or more characters (including vehicles, of course!) compete.

Conflicts can be resolved in different ways depending on preferences and context:
1. Ask a single closed question. The Oracle's answer determines the outcome of the conflict.
2. Ask a series of closed questions to resolve current single actions.
3. Use the rules of Harm & Luck below.

Note that the Twist Counter **does not apply** to Harm & Luck. Instead, it is used regularly if the Conflict is handled with closed questions.

If the conflict is resolved by applying damage to the Luck trait, roll the dice to determine whether the protagonist causes damage to the opponent or suffers damage due to counterattack or failed defense. The rolls are player facing only.

The damage reduces the Luck of the target, whether protagonist or NPC. When the Luck runs out, the character has lost the conflict.

The final outcome depends on the context. Do you get caught? Are you seriously injured? You may even die if that fits the narrative.

| Answer      | Do you get what you want?                               | Harm    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Yes, and... | You get what you want, and something else.              | Cause 3 |
| Yes...      | You get what you want.                                  | Cause 2 |
| Yes, but... | You get what you want, but at a cost.                   | Cause 1 |
| No, but...  | You don’t get what you want, but it’s not a total loss. | Take 1  |
| No...       | You don’t get what you were after.                      | Take 2  |
| No, and...  | You don’t get what you want, and things get worse.      | Take 3  |

### Determine the mood of the next scene

At the end of the current scene sometimes you will be clear about the direction to take, other times you may need to determine the general mood of the next one. In this case roll 1d6 and consult the following table:

|  D6 |   Next Scene   |
|:---:|:--------------:|
| 1-3 | Dramatic scene |
| 4-5 |   Quiet Scene  |
|  6  |   Meanwhile…   |

- A **dramatic scene** does not break the tension of the previous scene but carries it further forward, introducing further obstacles or difficulties.
- During a **quiet scene** there is time to take a breath, to heal, to make plans for the next steps and to deepen relationships.
- A **meanwhile scene** takes place somewhere else, other than where the hero is. It cuts to villains or other plot-important characters.

### Open-Ended Question or Get Inspired

To answer an Open-Ended question, roll 1d6 once on each of the Inspiration Tables (roll at least a verb and a noun, adjectives are optional).

### When the story ends

At the end of the adventure you may add another trait to the character. It is better that this is related to how the story just ended and can be either a Skill, Gear, a new Frailty, or even a new Nemesis! You can also modify an existing trait to better represent an enhanced expertise.

Also update the list of **NPCs**, **Locations**, and **Events** that may show up again in future adventures.

## **Factions & Organizations**

- **Gear**: **Ever-Burning Lantern, Map That Changes at Dusk**  
- **Goal**: To ensure no traveler ever feels truly alone.  
- **Motive**: A belief that light—whether from a candle, a home, or a kind word—should never be hidden.  
- **Nemesis**: The **Silent Fog**, an unnatural mist that obscures paths and memories.  

Scattered throughout Everhollow, the **Lantern-Keepers** are wayfarers, guides, and storytellers. They walk the roads, tending to forgotten paths, lighting hearths in abandoned homes, and ensuring that **no place is ever truly lost**. Each Keeper carries an **enchanted lantern**, which flickers when someone nearby needs help. They also collect and share **stories of hope and kindness**, believing that the past should never be forgotten.  

But **not all places want to be found**, and the **Silent Fog**—a strange mist that erases paths and memories—seems to work against them. Some believe the Keepers have **angered something old**, while others whisper that the **fog is protecting something** they were never meant to see.

The **Hearthwoven Circle** is not a secret society, but it is elusive—no one quite knows **who belongs** to it, only that their gifts **appear when needed most**. A scarf left on a doorstep on the first cold night, a **teacup that soothes an aching heart**, a quilt that **holds the scent of childhood**—these are the work of Hearthweavers.  

Each member **stitches magic into everyday life**, but they have a rule: **they can only make for others, never for themselves**. Their greatest rival is the **Frayed Thread**, a weaver who undoes their magic, unraveling not just fabric, but friendships, trust, and **the warmth of home itself**.

The **Bookbinders of Everword** travel the land collecting **stories, secrets, and lost memories**. Their libraries are unlike any others—the books **breathe, whisper, and shift** when no one is looking. Each bookbinder carries a **blank tome**, into which they write moments too precious to be forgotten.  

But some stories are **dangerous**, and the **Torn Page** believes that certain histories should **never be retold**. They steal books, rewrite the past, and silence those who seek to uncover forgotten truths. The Bookbinders must decide: **is every story worth remembering? Or are some pages better left blank?**

In hidden groves, atop forgotten rooftops, and beneath ancient ruins, the **Moonwake Gardeners** cultivate **flowers that bloom only under the stars**. Their magic is subtle—**a vine that leads the way home, a petal that holds a secret, a flower that only blooms for those who need it most**.  

But their greatest rival, the **Root-Takers**, seek to **claim magic for themselves**. They believe no plant should **grow wild**, and no flower should bloom **beyond the reach of those who would sell it**. The Gardeners must work in the shadows, protecting the delicate wonders that would otherwise be lost.  

### **The Everclock Society**

- **Motive**: A belief that **everything can be fixed, except regret**.  
- **Nemesis**: The **Hollow Hours**, a group that steals time from those who waste it.  

The **Everclock Society** does not control time, but they **listen to it**. They **fix clocks that never should have stopped, mend broken sundials, and repair old hourglasses**—because in Everhollow, some timepieces hold **memories, magic, and unfinished moments**.  

But the **Hollow Hours** believe **time is wasted on the unworthy**. They **steal moments**—not in years, but in **seconds stolen from daydreams, from conversations that could have been longer, from laughter that fades too soon**. The Everclock Society must **restore what is lost**, without ever breaking their own rule: **time must never be reversed, no matter how much someone longs for the past.**

- **Nemesis**: The **Vanishing Mile**, a force that erases roads and pathways, making places disappear forever.  

The **Wayfarers of the Silent Bell** are wanderers who **follow paths that no longer exist**—roads that appear only at twilight, bridges that cross into memory, staircases that lead to places that once were. Their bells ring **only for those who are truly lost**, guiding them back to where they belong.  

But something is **erasing the roads**, and the **Vanishing Mile** grows stronger. The Wayfarers must **walk the forgotten paths, ensuring no place—and no one—is ever lost for good**.  

## **Creatures of Everhollow**
