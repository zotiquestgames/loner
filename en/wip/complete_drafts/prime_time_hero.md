# Prime Time Hero

## Introduction

*Prime Time Hero* follows the following design principles:

1. **Portable**: to play you will need a few common (six-sided) dice and writing materials. Anything else is optional and not essential.
2. **Rules-Light**: the game relies on a few rules and only one solving mechanic, easy to learn and eventually to memorize.
3. **Tag-based**: characters and situations are defined only by qualitative descriptors and no quantitative characteristics.

With a focus on quick resolutions, **Prime Time Hero** throws you headfirst into the heart of the action. Your character will be defined by thematic tags, like *"Smooth Talker"*, *"Gadget Whiz"*, or *"Street Smart"*.

### What is a Role Playing Game (RPG)?
A role-playing game (RPG) is a type of game in which players assume the roles of fictional characters and act out their actions and decisions within a narrative or imaginary setting. The outcome of these actions and decisions is often determined by a set of rules and game mechanics, such as dice rolls or statistical attributes of the characters. Players may also collaborate to create a shared story or narrative through their characters' actions and interactions.

### What is a Solo RPG?

In a solo RPG a single player takes on the roles of one or more characters, while also simultaneously managing some elements of the game world. These games typically involve the use of a rule system and game mechanics to determine the outcome of actions taken by the player-controlled characters. 
Unlike a gamebook (such as the Fighting Fantasy, Lone Wolf, and Tunnels & Trolls series) a solo RPG is not a form of interactive, forked narrative in which outcomes are pre-determined and limited by the author's choices.

Through the interaction of player, oracle, tools, and prompts, the character's actions will build an **emergent narrative** within whose boundaries anything can be attempted, without predetermined limits.

### Safety Tools
You will play alone, but be sure to play in an environment that is comfortable for you, without overexerting yourself, and reserve the option to stop as soon as you feel uncomfortable for any reason, physical or emotional. Don't be afraid to tackle new themes, but do so in full awareness of your boundaries.

### Minimum Requirements
To play *Prime Time Hero* you will need:
- **4 six sided dice** (also known as d6s): two pairs of different colors
- **Paper and writing tools**: at least a sheet of scrap paper and and pencil, but index cards or sticky notes are a fine addition
- **Character sheet**: you may use the provided sheet at the back or a simple index card.
- **Notebook**: *Prime Time Hero* is not a solo journaling game, you can easily play it in the "theater of mind". But you can keep track of you game if you feel the need!

## The 1980s Action-Adventure World

The world of *Prime Time Hero* is a heightened version of the 1980s, where:

- **Technology is cutting-edge but analog**: Computers have green screens, phones are car-mounted, and every gadget has blinking lights
- **Heroes have codes of honor**: Violence is a last resort, innocent people are always protected, and the good guys always win
- **Locations are exotic but accessible**: From Hawaiian beaches to Swiss ski lodges, adventure is always one flight away
- **Problems are personal**: Every case involves helping regular people against corrupt officials, greedy corporations, or international criminals
- **Style matters**: Fast cars, designer suits, and perfectly feathered hair are essential tools of the trade
- **Everything is slightly over-the-top**: Explosions are bigger, stunts are crazier, and one-liners are snappier

### Playable Themes

- Corporate espionage and white-collar crime
- International intrigue and exotic locations
- Small-town corruption and local mysteries
- High-tech heists and elaborate cons
- Environmental protection and social justice
- Personal vendettas and family secrets
- Celebrity scandals and entertainment industry drama

### Timeline

**Early 1980s (1980-1983)**: The Cold War is at its peak, technology is rapidly advancing, optimism about the future runs high, and heroes are starting to use computers and high-tech gadgets.

**Mid-1980s (1984-1986)**: The height of the era - neon everywhere, synthesizer music, corporate excess, and heroes with the most outrageous vehicles and gadgets.

**Late 1980s (1987-1989)**: Environmental consciousness is growing, the Berlin Wall is coming down, but corporate greed and international crime are still major threats.

## Characters

In the world of *Prime Time Hero*, you are the protagonist of your own action-adventure series. You're resourceful, charismatic, and always fighting for justice, but you do it with style and a strict moral code.

### Everything is a Character!

In *Prime Time Hero* Non-Playing Characters (NPCs), Foes, Organizations, Monsters, and even relevant objects like vehicles are characters too!

Your Protagonist is described by some fixed traits:

- **Name**: The name should be iconic and consistent with the tone and setting of the story.
- **Concept**: A concise description of the character's profession, background, and abilities. The best are adjective-name pairings, like *"Rogue CIA Agent"* or *"Hawaiian Private Eye"*.
- **Skills** (x2): Abilities not necessarily character-specific but not characteristics common to all. *"Smart"* is not a skill, *"Jury-Rigging Genius"* is.
- **Frailty**: Something that could potentially get in the way of the character, either physically, mentally, or socially.
- **Gear** (x2): Particular equipment supplied to the character in coherence with the setting. Everyday items are taken for granted and do not fall under this trait.
- **Goal**: The long-term objective.
- **Motive**: What drives the pursuit of the goal.
- **Nemesis**: A person or organization that hinders the protagonist. It can emerge during the first game sessions, it may or may or not be the direct antagonist of the story, ready to appear to make life even more difficult
- **Luck**: The measure of a character's ability to avoid ill fortune or an inauspicious outcome. It applies only in Conflicts and automatically recharges when they end. Luck starts and caps at 6.

These **traits** are described by **tags**, descriptive words or phrases that can identify anything in the game world. Even the **details** of the environment in which the action moves and **conditions** (physical or mental) of the characters are tags. 

**They are qualitative representations. They are not quantitative measures.**

### Character Traits

You can use these traits to create a character on the fly, mix them, or just use them as inspiration.

## Rules

*Prime Time Hero* is a minimalist Solo Role Playing Game designed to be played with only one character (the Protagonist). You'll guide them through the story that will unravel during the game, asking closed questions to an Oracle which will help you overturn your expectations.

Every now and then you will be surprised with an unexpected twist!

### Keep The Action In Motion

A game in *Prime Time Hero* is a succession of scenes. 
A scene is a unit of time in which a certain action takes place in pursuit of a certain short-term goal. 

In *Prime Time Hero* at each scene:
1. **Identify what you expect from the scene**. Compared to traits, goal, and motivation determine the Protagonist's action. What might be the reaction of the game world?
2. **Test your expectations**. When you are uncertain (or overconfident) about the reaction to your actions, [ask the Oracle](#consulting-the-oracle) a closed question (answer is Yes or No), considering the tags involved to determine if there is an [Advantage or Disadvantage](#advantage-and-disadvantage).
3. **Interpret the result**. Is the Oracle's answer in line with your expectations? If not, in the context in which the scene takes place, how should an answer that subverts them be considered?

This sequence will come to you naturally after some practice. Use it as a guideline the first few times.

### Consulting the Oracle

When you need to test your expectations you'll ask the Oracle a closed question.

You'll need 2d6 in one color (**Chance Dice**), and 2d6 in another (**Risk Dice**).

To resolve a closed question, roll one **Chance Die** and one **Risk Die**:
- If the Chance Die is highest, the answer is **Yes**. 
- If the Risk Die is highest, the answer is **No**.
- If both are low (3 or less), add a **but...**. 
- If both are high (4 or more), add an **and...**.
- If both are equal, the answer is **Yes, but...**. Add a point to the **[Twist Counter](#twist-counter)**.

| Dice Value |    Chance Die > Risk Die   | Risk Die > Chance Die |
|:----------:|:--------------------------:|:---------------------:|
|  Both < 4  |         Yes, but...        |       No, but...      |
|  Both > 3  |         Yes, and...        |       No, and...      |
| Mismatched |             Yes            |           No          |
|            |                            |                       |
|    Equal   | Add 1 to the Twist Counter |                       |

### Advantage and Disadvantage

If circumstances or positive tags grant an advantage, add a **Chance Die** to the roll. Otherwise, when hindrances or negative tag cause a disadvantage, add a **Risk Die**. In both cases keep only the higher die of the added type when you check the roll.

Consider tags **intuitively and not quantitatively**, using the context of the situation at play. It is important to keep the flow of play fast and not accounting for advantages and disadvantages numerically!

### Twist Counter

The Twist Counter is a measure of the rising tension in the narrative. At the beginning is set to 0. Every time a double throw (dice are equal) happens, add 1 to the Counter. If the Counter is below three, consider the answer as "**Yes, but...**". Otherwise a **Twist** happens and resets the Counter.

Roll 2d6 and consult the following Twist Table to determine what kind of twist happens. 

| D6 |      Subject       |        Action       |
|:--:|:------------------:|:-------------------:|
|  1 |    A third party   |       Appears       |
|  2 |      The hero      | Alters the location |
|  3 |    An encounter    |    Helps the hero   |
|  4 |  A physical event  |   Hinders the hero  |
|  5 | An emotional event |   Changes the goal  |
|  6 |      An object     |    Ends the scene   |

Interpret the two-word sentence in the context of the current scene. Twists will keep the plot and events going in unexpected ways.

### Improvised Gadgets

The heart of 1980s action-adventure is the protagonist's ability to create amazing solutions from everyday objects. When your hero needs to improvise a gadget or solution:

1. **Describe what you're trying to accomplish** and what materials are available
2. **Ask the Oracle** if your improvisation works, considering relevant Skills as Advantage
3. **Apply appropriate tags** to represent your new gadget temporarily

Examples: Turning a microwave into an EMP device, using compressed air and PVC pipe to create a pneumatic launcher, or converting a car stereo into a radio jammer.

### Vehicle Chases

Vehicle chases are resolved like Conflicts, but with these special considerations:

- Your vehicle's traits (speed, handling, armor) provide Advantage or Disadvantage
- Environmental hazards (traffic, weather, terrain) add Risk Dice
- Spectacular crashes and narrow escapes are encouraged
- Vehicles can take "damage" in the form of negative traits that persist until repaired

### The Episode Structure

Each game session should follow the classic TV episode structure:

1. **Cold Open**: A brief scene establishing the episode's tone and hook
2. **Title Sequence**: Take a moment to appreciate your character's style
3. **Act I**: Introduction of the problem and key NPCs
4. **Act II**: Investigation, complications, and the first major setback  
5. **Act III**: The plan comes together and the final confrontation
6. **Tag Scene**: A brief denouement showing the aftermath

### Conflicts

A *Conflict* is any situation in which opponents clash, attacking, defending, or wearing each other down in order to win.
This applies both in a practical and metaphorical sense. 

So, a Conflict is not only limited to combat (or fighting) in the strict sense but also to competitive situations (such as contests, duels, verbal confrontations, etc.) in which two or more characters (including vehicles, of course!) compete.

Conflicts can be resolved in different ways depending on preferences and context:
1. Ask a single closed question. The Oracle's answer determines the outcome of the conflict.
2. Ask a series of closed questions to resolve current single actions.
3. Use the rules of Harm & Luck below.

Note that the Twist Counter **does not apply** to Harm & Luck. Instead, it is used regularly if the Conflict is handled with closed questions.

If the conflict is resolved by applying damage to the Luck trait, roll the dice to determine whether the protagonist causes damage to the opponent or suffers damage due to counterattack or failed defense. The rolls are player facing only.

The damage reduces the Luck of the target, whether protagonist or NPC. When the Luck runs out, the character has lost the conflict.

The final outcome depends on the context. Do you get caught? Are you seriously injured? You may even die if that fits the narrative.

| Answer      | Do you get what you want?                               | Harm    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Yes, and... | You get what you want, and something else.              | Cause 3 |
| Yes...      | You get what you want.                                  | Cause 2 |
| Yes, but... | You get what you want, but at a cost.                   | Cause 1 |
| No, but...  | You don't get what you want, but it's not a total loss. | Take 1  |
| No...       | You don't get what you were after.                      | Take 2  |
| No, and...  | You don't get what you want, and things get worse.      | Take 3  |

### Determine the mood of the next scene

At the end of the current scene sometimes you will be clear about the direction to take, other times you may need to determine the general mood of the next one. In this case roll 1d6 and consult the following table:

|  D6 |   Next Scene   |
|:---:|:--------------:|
| 1-3 | Dramatic scene |
| 4-5 |   Quiet Scene  |
|  6  |   Meanwhile…   |

- A **dramatic scene** does not break the tension of the previous scene but carries it further forward, introducing further obstacles or difficulties.
- During a **quiet scene** there is time to take a breath, to heal, to make plans for the next steps and to deepen relationships.
- A **meanwhile scene** takes place somewhere else, other than where the hero is. It cuts to villains or other plot-important characters.

### Open-Ended Question or Get Inspired

To answer an Open-Ended question, roll 1d6 once on each of the Inspiration Tables (roll at least a verb and a noun, adjectives are optional).

### When the story ends

At the end of the adventure you may add another trait to the character. It is better that this is related to how the story just ended and can be either a Skill, Gear, a new Frailty, or even a new Nemesis! You can also modify an existing trait to better represent an enhanced expertise.

Also update the list of **NPCs**, **Locations**, and **Events** that may show up again in future adventures.

## Advanced Play Options

### Series Campaign Rules

If you want to play **Prime Time Hero** as an ongoing series rather than one-shots, consider these additions:

**Recurring Characters**: Keep a stable of allies, contacts, and enemies who can appear across multiple episodes. Your helicopter pilot, your government contact, your reliable informant - they become part of your show's "cast."

**Story Arcs**: Plant seeds in early episodes that bloom into major storylines later. Maybe that corrupt businessman you exposed has a brother seeking revenge, or that experimental technology you destroyed was just a prototype.

**Character Development**: After every 3-5 episodes, you may:
- Add a new Skill related to recent adventures
- Upgrade existing Gear with new capabilities  
- Develop a new Contact who can provide assistance
- Gain a new Nemesis based on your actions
- Remove a Frailty you've overcome through character growth

**Reputation System**: As your hero becomes famous (or infamous), their reputation precedes them. This can be:
- **Advantage** when people respect or fear you
- **Disadvantage** when you're too recognizable for stealth
- **Plot Driver** when enemies specifically target you

### Multi-Character Play

While designed for solo play, **Prime Time Hero** can accommodate multiple characters:

**Team Format**: Each player creates a specialist (the face, the tech expert, the driver, the muscle) working together like *The A-Team*

**Rival Format**: Players create competing investigators or agents working separate cases that occasionally intersect

**Guest Star Format**: One player has a main character while others rotate in as guest stars, contacts, or even reformed villains

### Difficulty Variants

**Pulp Hero Mode**: Your character is nearly invincible. Reduce all damage taken by 1 and add an extra Chance Die to all dramatic actions.

**Gritty Mode**: The world is darker and more dangerous. All conflicts use Harm & Luck rules, and healing takes longer.

**High Tech Mode**: Set in the late 1980s with more advanced technology available. Gadgets are more sophisticated but also more likely to be detected or countered.

### Random Episode Generators

**Cold Open Generator** (Roll 1d6):
1. **Action Scene**: Start mid-chase or mid-fight
2. **Mystery Hook**: Discover a body or crime scene  
3. **Personal Moment**: Character development scene
4. **Exposition Dump**: Meeting with client or contact
5. **Dramatic Irony**: Show villain's plan before hero knows
6. **False Normal**: Peaceful scene about to be disrupted

**Episode Title Generator** (Roll 2d6):
- First die determines first word
- Second die determines second word
- Add "The" if it sounds better

| D6 | First Word | Second Word |
|----|------------|-------------|
| 1  | Deadly     | Game        |
| 2  | Silent     | Partner     |
| 3  | Golden     | Conspiracy  |
| 4  | Final      | Challenge   |
| 5  | Secret     | Mission     |
| 6  | Double     | Cross       |

**Cliffhanger Generator** (Roll 1d6):
1. **Death Trap**: Hero caught in elaborate trap
2. **Revelation**: Major character revealed as traitor
3. **Explosion**: Something important about to blow up
4. **Pursuit**: High-speed chase reaches critical moment
5. **Dilemma**: Must choose between two important things
6. **Arrival**: Unexpected person arrives at worst moment

### Setting Variations

**Tropical Paradise**: Focus on island locations, resorts, and maritime adventures. Think *Magnum P.I.* with beach settings, yacht clubs, and helicopter tours.

**Urban Jungle**: City-based adventures with corporate espionage, high-tech crime, and metropolitan sophistication. Think *Miami Vice* meets *Knight Rider*.

**International Intrigue**: Globe-trotting adventures with diplomatic immunity, embassy parties, and exotic locations. Think *James Bond* television series.

**Small Town Secrets**: Rural or small-town setting where everyone knows everyone, but dark secrets lurk beneath the surface. Think *Twin Peaks* with 1980s action.

## Exploring the World

In *Prime Time Hero*, exploration takes you to exotic locations around the globe, from tropical paradises to cosmopolitan cities to remote wilderness areas. Your adventures might take you from a penthouse suite in Monaco to a hidden temple in Thailand, all in pursuit of justice and adventure.

### Preparation

* **Define Your Destination:** Choose a specific location based on your current case, or roll on the Location tables for inspiration. Consider how this location ties into your investigation or mission.
* **Choose Your Mode of Travel:** Your character likely has access to various vehicles - sports cars, helicopters, speedboats, or even private jets. Consider your resources and the urgency of the situation.
* **Make Contacts:** Every location has local contacts, informants, and allies. Consider who might help you in this new place.

### The Journey

#### A. Luxury Travel

* **Comfort Check:** When traveling in style (first class flights, luxury hotels), you automatically arrive refreshed and with potential social connections made during travel.
* **Resource Check:** Roll to see if your expense account covers all the luxury. On a failure, you'll need to be more careful with spending or find alternative accommodations.

#### B. Covert Travel

* **Stealth Check:** When traveling under false identities or avoiding detection, ask the Oracle if your cover holds. Your espionage skills provide Advantage.
* **Border Crossing:** Some locations require careful navigation of customs, border guards, or hostile governments. Use appropriate skills and gear.

#### C. Emergency Travel

* **Transportation Check:** When you need to get somewhere fast, ask the Oracle if suitable transport is available. Your network of contacts and resources provide Advantage.
* **Pursuit Check:** If someone is trying to follow or stop you, this becomes a Chase sequence using vehicle rules.

#### Reaching Your Destination

Upon reaching your destination, the location should feel like it jumped out of a 1980s travel brochure or spy thriller. Roll on location tables for specific details, or use the Oracle to determine what kind of scene awaits you.

## 1980s Locations

The world of *Prime Time Hero* spans glamorous international destinations, each with their own flavor of adventure and intrigue.

### Tropical Paradises
Locations like Hawaii, the Caribbean, or the French Riviera offer beach resorts, yacht clubs, and coral reefs hiding underwater secrets. Expect corrupt resort developers, international arms dealers, and mysterious archaeological sites.

### International Cities
