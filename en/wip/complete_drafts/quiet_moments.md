# Quiet Moments

***Quiet Moments*** is a solo tabletop RPG adventure set in the gentle rhythms of everyday life, where small victories matter and ordinary moments hold extraordinary meaning.

This minimalist Solo Role Playing Game is designed to explore the beauty of daily existence, personal growth, and the connections that make life meaningful through intimate storytelling and reflective gameplay.

## Introduction

*Quiet Moments* follows the following design principles:

1. **Portable**: to play you will need a few common (six-sided) dice and writing materials. Anything else is optional and not essential.
2. **Rules-Light**: the game relies on a few rules and only one solving mechanic, easy to learn and eventually to memorize.
3. **Tag-based**: characters and situations are defined only by qualitative descriptors and no quantitative characteristics.

With a focus on quiet resolutions, **Quiet Moments** draws you into the heart of ordinary life. Your character will be defined by thematic tags, like *Caring*, *Anxious*, *Creative*, or *Nostalgic*.

### What is a Role Playing Game (RPG)?

A role-playing game (RPG) is a way to explore a story by stepping into the role of a character and making choices as if you were them. The world responds to those choices, and together player and game create events that didn’t exist before.

Many RPGs focus on adventure and danger. *Quiet Moments* is different — here, the story can grow from small, everyday details: conversations over coffee, a walk in the rain, a change in routine.

If you’ve ever kept a journal, improvised a scene in a writing group, or become absorbed in a life-simulation game, you already know the feeling. You’re shaping a narrative one choice at a time, without knowing exactly where it will lead.

### What is a Solo RPG?

A solo RPG is a role-playing game you play alone, taking on one or more characters while also shaping the world around them. Instead of another player acting as referee, you use tools — such as an oracle, random tables, and prompts — to decide how the world reacts.

Unlike a gamebook, where every possible outcome is written in advance, a solo RPG is open-ended. Each choice, roll, and inspiration builds an **emergent narrative**, whether that’s a quiet afternoon of reflection, a slow-growing friendship, or the gentle shift of a life over time.

### Safety Tools

Even when playing alone, your comfort matters. Choose a space where you can relax, with as few distractions as possible. You’re free to pause at any time if something feels uncomfortable — physically, mentally, or emotionally.

It’s fine to explore new or challenging themes, but do so at your own pace and with a clear sense of your boundaries. This is your story, and you decide what belongs in it.

### Game Materials

To play *Quiet Moments* you will need:
- **4 six sided dice** (also known as d6s): two pairs of different colors
- **Paper and writing tools**: at least a sheet of scrap paper and and pencil, but index cards or sticky notes are a fine addition
- **Character sheet**: you may use the provided sheet at the back or a simple index card.
- **Notebook**: *Quiet Moments* is not a solo journaling game, you can easily play it in the "theater of mind". But you can keep track of you game if you feel the need!

## Characters

In the world of *Quiet Moments*, every person you encounter has their own inner life, dreams, and daily struggles that matter just as much as dramatic adventures.

### Everything is a Character!

In *Quiet Moments* Non-Playing Characters (NPCs), Family Members, Coworkers, Neighbors, Pets, and even meaningful places like favorite cafés or childhood homes are characters too!

Your Protagonist is described by some fixed traits:

- **Name**: The name should feel real and grounded, reflecting their background and the world they inhabit.
- **Concept**: A concise description of the character's role, personality, and current life phase. The best are adjective-noun pairings, like *"Thoughtful Teacher"* or *"Aspiring Baker"*.
- **Skills** (x2): Abilities that help navigate daily life and personal challenges. *"Good Listener"* and *"Green Thumb"* are more relevant than combat prowess.
- **Frailty**: Something that creates gentle obstacles or personal growth opportunities - social anxiety, perfectionism, or difficulty saying no.
- **Gear** (x2): Meaningful possessions that define character or enable their pursuits - grandmother's recipe box, worn leather journal, vintage camera.
- **Goal**: The long-term aspiration that gives life direction.
- **Motive**: What emotional need drives the pursuit of that goal.
- **Nemesis**: A person, habit, or situation that creates ongoing gentle conflict - not villains, but sources of stress, self-doubt, or complication.
- **Luck**: The measure of a character's ability to navigate social situations and daily challenges gracefully. It applies only in Conflicts and automatically recharges when they end. Luck starts and caps at 6.

These **traits** are described by **tags**, descriptive words or phrases that can identify anything in the game world. Even the **details** of environments like cozy kitchens or bustling farmer's markets and **conditions** like homesick or inspired are tags. 

**They are qualitative representations. They are not quantitative measures.**

## Rules

*Quiet Moments* is a minimalist Solo Role Playing Game designed to be played with only one character (the Protagonist). You'll guide them through the story that will unravel during the game, asking closed questions to an Oracle which will help you overturn your expectations.

Every now and then you will be surprised with an unexpected twist!

### Keep The Action In Motion

A game in *Quiet Moments* is a succession of scenes. 
A scene is a unit of time in which a certain action takes place in pursuit of a certain short-term goal. 

In *Quiet Moments* at each scene:
1. **Identify what you expect from the scene**. Compared to traits, goal, and motivation determine the Protagonist's action. What might be the reaction of the game world?
2. **Test your expectations**. When you are uncertain (or overconfident) about the reaction to your actions, [ask the Oracle](#consulting-the-oracle) a closed question (answer is Yes or No), considering the tags involved to determine if there is an [Advantage or Disadvantage](#advantage-and-disadvantage).
3. **Interpret the result**. Is the Oracle's answer in line with your expectations? If not, in the context in which the scene takes place, how should an answer that subverts them be considered?

This sequence will come to you naturally after some practice. Use it as a guideline the first few times.

### Consulting the Oracle

When you need to test your expectations you'll ask the Oracle a closed question.

You'll need 2d6 in one color (**Chance Dice**), and 2d6 in another (**Risk Dice**).

To resolve a closed question, roll one **Chance Die** and one **Risk Die**:
- If the Chance Die is highest, the answer is **Yes**. 
- If the Risk Die is highest, the answer is **No**.
- If both are low (3 or less), add a **but...**. 
- If both are high (4 or more), add an **and...**.
- If both are equal, the answer is **Yes, but...**. Add a point to the **[Twist Counter](#twist-counter)**.

| Dice Value |    Chance Die > Risk Die   | Risk Die > Chance Die |
|:----------:|:--------------------------:|:---------------------:|
|  Both < 4  |         Yes, but...        |       No, but...      |
|  Both > 3  |         Yes, and...        |       No, and...      |
| Mismatched |             Yes            |           No          |
|            |                            |                       |
|    Equal   | Add 1 to the Twist Counter |                       |

### Advantage and Disadvantage

If circumstances or positive tags grant an advantage, add a **Chance Die** to the roll. Otherwise, when hindrances or negative tag cause a disadvantage, add a **Risk Die**. In both cases keep only the higher die of the added type when you check the roll.

Consider tags **intuitively and not quantitatively**, using the context of the situation at play. It is important to keep the flow of play fast and not accounting for advantages and disadvantages numerically!

### Twist Counter

The Twist Counter is a measure of the rising tension in the narrative. At the beginning is set to 0. Every time a double throw (dice are equal) happens, add 1 to the Counter. If the Counter is below three, consider the answer as "**Yes, but...**". Otherwise a **Twist** happens and resets the Counter.

Roll 2d6 and consult the following Twist Table to determine what kind of twist happens. 

| D6 |      Subject       |        Action       |
|:--:|:------------------:|:-------------------:|
|  1 |    A neighbor      |       Arrives       |
|  2 |      The protagonist |   Recalls something |
|  3 |    A phone call    |    Brings news      |
|  4 |  Weather changes   |   Shifts the mood   |
|  5 | An old memory      |   Surfaces suddenly |
|  6 |    A small object  |    Reveals meaning  |

Interpret the two-word sentence in the context of the current scene. Twists will keep the plot and events going in unexpected ways.

### Conflicts

A *Conflict* in *Quiet Moments* is any situation involving emotional stakes, social tension, or personal challenges.
This includes difficult conversations, family disagreements, workplace stress, creative blocks, social anxiety, or internal struggles with self-doubt.

Conflicts can be resolved in different ways depending on preferences and context:
1. Ask a single closed question. The Oracle's answer determines the outcome of the conflict.
2. Ask a series of closed questions to resolve current single actions.
3. Use the rules of Harm & Luck below.

Note that the Twist Counter **does not apply** to Harm & Luck. Instead, it is used regularly if the Conflict is handled with closed questions.

If the conflict is resolved by applying damage to the Luck trait, roll the dice to determine whether the protagonist navigates the situation gracefully or experiences emotional strain. The rolls are player facing only.

The damage reduces the Luck of the target, whether protagonist or NPC. When the Luck runs out, the character has reached their emotional limit for the scene.

The final outcome depends on the context. Do they need space to recover? Is a relationship strained? Growth often comes through working past these moments.

| Answer      | Do you get what you want?                               | Harm    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Yes, and... | You get what you want, and something else.              | Cause 3 |
| Yes...      | You get what you want.                                  | Cause 2 |
| Yes, but... | You get what you want, but at a cost.                   | Cause 1 |
| No, but...  | You don't get what you want, but it's not a total loss. | Take 1  |
| No...       | You don't get what you were after.                      | Take 2  |
| No, and...  | You don't get what you want, and things get worse.      | Take 3  |

### Determine the mood of the next scene

At the end of the current scene sometimes you will be clear about the direction to take, other times you may need to determine the general mood of the next one. In this case roll 1d6 and consult the following table:

|  D6 |   Next Scene   |
|:---:|:--------------:|
| 1-3 | Contemplative scene |
| 4-5 |   Social Scene  |
|  6  |   Meanwhile…   |

- A **contemplative scene** allows for internal reflection, personal growth moments, or quiet activities that restore the spirit.
- During a **social scene** the focus shifts to relationships, community interactions, or shared activities with others.
- A **meanwhile scene** takes place elsewhere, focusing on other important people in the protagonist's life or community.

### Open-Ended Question or Get Inspired

To answer an Open-Ended question, roll 1d6 once on each of the Inspiration Tables (roll at least a verb and a noun, adjectives are optional).

### When the story ends

At the end of the adventure you may add another trait to the character. It is better that this is related to how the story just ended and can be either a Skill, Gear, a new Frailty, or even a new Nemesis! You can also modify an existing trait to better represent personal growth or life changes.

Also update the list of **NPCs**, **Locations**, and **Events** that may show up again in future adventures.

## Daily Rhythm Rules

The Daily Rhythm Rules form the emotional and mechanical core of *Quiet Moments*, creating a living, breathing simulation of how everyday life truly flows. These rules capture the subtle patterns that govern our daily existence - the way morning energy affects our entire day, how seasons shift our emotional landscape, and why stepping outside our comfort zones feels both necessary and terrifying.

### Quick Start

The *Daily Rhythm Rules* bring everyday patterns into play, shaping your character’s mood, energy, and routines. Use them to keep your story grounded and dynamic without adding heavy bookkeeping.

#### 1. Start of the Day (or Scene) – Energy Level

Roll **1d6** to see how ready your character feels:
1 = Depleted (Disadvantage on all actions)
2 = Low (Disadvantage on new/challenging actions)
3 = Cautious (No modifier, prefer routine)
4 = Steady (No modifier)
5 = Energized (Advantage on creative/social actions)
6 = Radiant (Advantage on all actions, can inspire others)

Energy can shift during the day due to events, activities, or weather.

#### 2. Seasonal Mood

Each season brings a general mood and a special advantage:

* **Spring:** New beginnings – once per season, automatically succeed at starting something new.
* **Summer:** Connection – social activities restore energy instead of costing it.
* **Autumn:** Reflection – once per day, reroll a failed Oracle question.
* **Winter:** Rest – advantage on activities done alone or in small groups.

#### 3. Comfort Routines

Pick 3–5 routines (e.g., morning coffee, Sunday calls).

* **In routine:** Advantage on related actions.
* **Breaking routine:** First time each day, roll with Disadvantage.
* **Growth moments:** Successfully act outside your comfort zone to add or change a routine.

#### 4. Weekly & Monthly Patterns

* **Weekly:** Each day of the week has its own mood/bonus (e.g., Tuesday = Advantage on work tasks, Saturday = Advantage on creative/leisure).
* **Monthly:** Roll 1d6 to set the month’s “arc” (Building, Peak, Harvest, Transition, Rest, Challenge).

#### 5. Weather & Other Modifiers

* **Sunny:** +1 Energy, advantage outdoors.
* **Rainy:** Advantage indoors, disadvantage travelling.
* **Stormy:** Energy shifts dramatically, more twists likely.
* **Extreme weather:** Major impacts, disrupt routines.

#### 6. Energy Debt & Recovery

* **Energy Debt:** Taking actions above your current energy level gives you Disadvantage on the next day’s Energy roll.
* **Recover:** Rest, nourishing activities, or time in routines restore balance.

### Energy Levels
Each morning (or at the start of a new scene), roll 1d6 to determine your character's energy level for that period. This isn't just physical energy - it represents emotional, mental, and spiritual capacity.

| D6 | Energy Level | Description | Mechanical Effect |
|----|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Depleted | Exhausted, overwhelmed, running on empty | Disadvantage on all actions; must rest before end of day |
| 2 | Low | Tired, struggling, just getting by | Disadvantage on challenging or new activities |
| 3 | Cautious | Careful, reserved, conserving energy | No modifier, but prefer routine activities |
| 4 | Steady | Normal, balanced, managing well | No modifier to actions |
| 5 | Energized | Motivated, capable, feeling good | Advantage on creative or social activities |
| 6 | Radiant | Inspired, powerful, everything flows | Advantage on all actions; can inspire others |

**Energy Flow**: Energy isn't static. It can shift based on:
- **Nourishing Activities**: Good meals, meaningful conversations, creative work, time in nature, adequate sleep
- **Draining Activities**: Conflict, overwork, neglecting self-care, prolonged stress, difficult decisions
- **Random Shifts**: Sometimes energy just changes - roll again if you get a double on any Oracle roll

### Seasonal Moods
Your character's emotional baseline shifts with the seasons. At the start of each seasonal period, note the current season's influence:

#### Spring (March-May): Renewal & Growth
- **Mood**: Hopeful, energetic, ready for new beginnings
- **Advantages**: Starting new projects, making changes, social connections, learning
- **Challenges**: Impatience with slow progress, overwhelming number of possibilities
- **Special Rule**: Once per spring, automatically succeed at beginning something new

#### Summer (June-August): Connection & Abundance  
- **Mood**: Social, confident, celebratory, expansive
- **Advantages**: Community activities, travel, celebrations, outdoor activities
- **Challenges**: Overcommitment, fear of missing out, ignoring responsibilities
- **Special Rule**: Social activities never cost energy, instead they restore it

#### Autumn (September-November): Reflection & Harvest
- **Mood**: Contemplative, nostalgic, grateful, preparing
- **Advantages**: Completing projects, organizing, family connections, skill development
- **Challenges**: Melancholy, resistance to change, dwelling on past
- **Special Rule**: Gain insight from past experiences - reroll one failed Oracle question per day

#### Winter (December-February): Introspection & Rest
- **Mood**: Quiet, deep, protective, inward-focused
- **Advantages**: Self-reflection, planning, intimate conversations, creative work
- **Challenges**: Isolation, sadness, lack of motivation, cabin fever
- **Special Rule**: Gain advantage on all activities done alone or in small, intimate groups

### Routine Comfort Zones
Every character develops routines that provide stability and comfort. At character creation and after significant life changes, establish 3-5 **Comfort Routines**:

**Examples of Comfort Routines:**
- Morning coffee and newspaper
- Evening walks around the neighborhood  
- Sunday phone calls with family
- Weekly grocery shopping at the same store
- Friday movie nights
- Bedtime reading ritual

**Mechanical Effects:**
- **In Routine**: Gain advantage on Oracle rolls when acting within established routines
- **Breaking Routine**: First time each day you act outside comfort zones, roll with disadvantage
- **Growth Moments**: Successfully acting outside comfort zones allows you to add new routines or modify existing ones

### Weekly Rhythms
Different days of the week carry their own emotional weight and social expectations:

| Day | Typical Mood | Common Activities | Special Considerations |
|-----|-------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Monday | Overwhelmed, Resistant | Work begins, planning | Disadvantage on starting new personal projects |
| Tuesday | Focused, Productive | Deep work, catching up | Advantage on work-related activities |
| Wednesday | Steady, Balanced | Mid-week routines | No special modifiers - neutral day |
| Thursday | Anticipatory, Social | Planning weekend, socializing | Advantage on making social plans |
| Friday | Excited, Celebratory | Finishing work, social events | Energy naturally increases |
| Saturday | Free, Creative | Personal projects, fun activities | Advantage on creative and leisure activities |
| Sunday | Reflective, Preparatory | Rest, family, planning ahead | Advantage on self-care and reflection |

### Monthly Cycles
Every month brings its own arc of energy and focus. Roll 1d6 at the start of each month:

1. **Building Month**: Energy grows throughout the month, projects gain momentum
2. **Peak Month**: High energy and productivity, everything feels possible  
3. **Harvest Month**: Completing things, seeing results of past efforts
4. **Transition Month**: Changes and shifts, old patterns ending
5. **Rest Month**: Lower energy, focus on restoration and planning
6. **Challenge Month**: Obstacles arise, but overcoming them brings growth

### Energy Debt
When you push beyond your energy level (taking actions that would normally require higher energy), you accumulate **Energy Debt**. Each point of debt gives disadvantage on the next day's energy roll. Energy debt can only be paid off through genuine rest and self-care.

### Rhythm Disruption
Major life events disrupt established rhythms:
- **Positive Disruptions**: New job, marriage, birth, moving to a better home
- **Negative Disruptions**: Loss, illness, job loss, relationship ending
- **Neutral Disruptions**: Moving, schedule changes, seasonal transitions

When disruption occurs, roll 2d6:
- 2-3: Complete rhythm chaos - all routines must be re-established
- 4-5: Major disruption - half of routines need adjustment  
- 6-8: Moderate disruption - one or two routines affected
- 9-10: Minor disruption - temporary adjustment period
- 11-12: Adaptable transition - routines bend but don't break

### Biorhythm Tracking (Optional)
For deeper simulation, track your character's personal rhythms:

**Physical Cycle** (23 days): Affects energy, health, physical activities
**Emotional Cycle** (28 days): Affects relationships, mood, creativity
**Intellectual Cycle** (33 days): Affects learning, decision-making, problem-solving

Roll 1d6 for each cycle weekly:
- 1-2: Low phase (disadvantage on related activities)
- 3-4: Neutral phase (no modifier)
- 5-6: High phase (advantage on related activities)

### Momentum Building
Certain activities build momentum over time:

**Daily Momentum**: Repeating positive activities (exercise, creative work, meditation) for consecutive days builds momentum:
- 3 days: Small advantage on related activities
- 7 days: Moderate advantage and energy boost
- 14 days: Strong advantage and habit formation
- 30 days: Permanent routine established

**Breaking Momentum**: Missing more than 2 consecutive days breaks the chain and requires starting over.

### Social Energy Exchange
Interactions with others affect your energy based on relationship dynamics:

**Energy Givers** (Supportive people): 
- Spending time together restores 1 energy level
- Deep conversations can shift you up 2 energy levels

**Energy Neutrals** (Most casual interactions):
- No energy change, but can provide information or minor assistance

**Energy Drains** (Difficult people or situations):
- Prolonged interaction drops energy 1 level
- Conflict situations can drop energy 2 levels

### Micro-Seasons and Weather
Daily weather affects mood and energy:

**Sunny Days**: +1 to energy rolls, advantage on outdoor activities
**Rainy Days**: Cozy bonus for indoor activities, disadvantage on travel
**Stormy Weather**: Dramatic energy shifts, unexpected events more likely
**Gray/Overcast**: Slight energy penalty, but good for contemplative activities
**First nice day after bad weather**: Automatic energy boost
**Extreme weather**: Major energy impacts and routine disruptions

### Life Phase Modifiers
Different life stages bring different rhythms:

**Childhood/Teens**: High energy variance, rapid mood changes, learning advantages
**Young Adult**: High energy, risk-taking, relationship focus, career uncertainty
**Established Adult**: Stable routines, family focus, responsibility weight
**Middle Age**: Wisdom bonus, health awareness, legacy thinking
**Older Adult**: Routine importance, memory bonus, relationship depth

### Circadian Preferences
Each character has natural energy patterns:

**Early Bird**: High energy mornings, advantage on morning activities, evening penalty
**Night Owl**: Low morning energy, penalty on early activities, evening/night advantages  
**Steady**: Consistent energy throughout day, no time-of-day bonuses or penalties

### Holiday and Anniversary Effects
Special dates carry emotional weight:

**Personal Anniversaries**: Death dates, relationship milestones, achievement dates
- Roll 2d6 for emotional impact: 2-5 (difficult), 6-8 (mixed), 9-12 (celebratory)

**Cultural Holidays**: Christmas, birthdays, New Year, cultural celebrations
- Can provide energy boosts or create social pressure and energy drains

**Forgotten Dates**: Sometimes memories surface unexpectedly
- When you roll doubles on any Oracle roll, consider if this connects to a forgotten anniversary

### Recovery Rituals
Characters develop personal methods for restoring energy:

**Quick Recovery** (1 scene): Coffee break, short walk, brief phone call, favorite song
**Medium Recovery** (1 day): Good meal, full night's sleep, hobby time, social visit
**Deep Recovery** (1 week): Vacation, retreat, major life change, intensive self-care

### Integration with Oracle System
The Daily Rhythm Rules integrate seamlessly with the core Oracle mechanics:

- **Energy Level** affects the interpretation of Oracle answers
- **Seasonal Mood** can grant advantage/disadvantage on relevant questions
- **Routine Comfort** modifies rolls for familiar vs. unfamiliar situations
- **Energy Debt** creates ongoing disadvantage until resolved
- **Momentum** provides cumulative bonuses for sustained activities

### Using Rhythms for Story Pacing
These mechanics naturally create story structure:

**Daily Arcs**: Energy levels create natural ups and downs within single days
**Weekly Patterns**: Different days encourage different types of scenes
**Monthly Cycles**: Provide larger story arcs with building tension and resolution
**Seasonal Stories**: Allow for year-long character development narratives
**Life Phase Stories**: Support multi-year campaigns following major life transitions

## Challenges & Obstacles

In *Quiet Moments*, the most meaningful struggles are not battles with monsters, but the frictions and pressures of everyday life. These challenges can take many forms: a person whose demands pull you off balance, an inner voice that questions your worth, or a circumstance that quietly drains your energy.

Each entry in this section is written as a “character” — complete with concept, skills, frailty, gear, goal, motive, and nemesis — so you can treat them mechanically just like any other person or place in the game. Whether they are an overbearing boss, a shifting season, or a bout of self-doubt, these obstacles help shape your story and give texture to your protagonist’s journey.

## Appendix A: Session Flow

A lean loop you can follow every time. Use this when you want structure without losing the game’s softness.

### Flow (at a glance)

1. **Set Context**

   * Note **season**, **week/day**, and any **monthly arc** in effect.
   * Roll **Energy** for the day or scene; apply **weather**.
   * Mark **comfort routines** that might apply.

2. **Frame a Scene**

   * Where/when, immediate purpose, stakes.
   * If unclear, roll **Next Scene** (1–3 Dramatic, 4–5 Quiet, 6 Meanwhile).

3. **Act → Ask → Interpret**

   * If an outcome is uncertain, **ask the Oracle**.
   * Apply **Adv/Disadv** from tags, Energy, routines, season, weather.
   * Read the result (Yes/No + and/but), **update fiction**.
   * On **doubles**: +1 **Twist Counter**; at 3, trigger a **Twist** and reset.

4. **Handle Conflicts (when tension sticks)**

   * Pick a method:

     * **Single Question** (fast resolution), or
     * **Series of Questions** (action beats), or
     * **Harm & Luck** (attrition: 3/2/1 cause vs. 1/2/3 take).
   * Resolve, then return to the scene.

5. **Maintain Rhythms**

   * Adjust **Energy** from nourishing/draining events.
   * Track **Momentum** chains, **Energy Debt**, routine changes.

6. **Close the Scene**

   * Update NPCs/locations/conditions.
   * If needed, **roll Next Scene** and loop.
   * If the goal feels reached or the arc levels out, **end the session**:

     * Add/modify a trait; update lists for future play.

### Quick modifier checklist (use as you roll)

* **Tags**: relevant skills/details/conditions.

* **Season**: Spring auto-start; Summer socials restore energy; Autumn 1 reroll/day; Winter solo/small-group Advantage.
* **Routines**: in-routine Advantage; first break each day Disadvantage.
* **Weather**: sunny +1 Energy & outdoor Advantage; rainy indoor Advantage & travel Disadvantage; storms = swingy energy/twists.
