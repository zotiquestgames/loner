# Loner: Grand Strategy

**Loner: Grand Strategy** is a solo narrative game where you take on the roles of multiple factions competing for control, influence, or survival in a shared world. Drawing inspiration from Engel's Matrix Games and the minimalist mechanics of the Loner Creator’s Kit, this game emphasizes emergent storytelling, strategic maneuvering, and oracular-driven surprises.

With no need for other players, dice rolls and structured prompts guide your journey, ensuring an engaging, strategic narrative unfolds.

### What is a Matrix Game?

A Matrix Game is a narrative-driven strategy game where players represent factions, groups, or characters pursuing their own objectives within a shared world. Unlike traditional board games, there are no predefined movements or outcomes. Instead, players present arguments to propose actions, supported by their resources, traits, or the game's context. The validity and success of these arguments are evaluated through structured rules, often with dice rolls or facilitator judgments shaping the results.

Matrix Games prioritize creativity and collaboration, encouraging players to build a shared story through their actions and decisions. The game evolves dynamically, driven by player input and unpredictable twists.

### What is a Solo Matrix Game?

In a solo Matrix Game, a single player manages multiple factions or perspectives within the game world. The player takes on the roles of these factions, presenting arguments and resolving their outcomes using oracular tools, random tables, and predefined rules. This ensures that the game remains engaging and unpredictable, even without other participants.

Unlike a traditional strategy game, where predefined mechanics dictate outcomes, a solo Matrix Game relies on emergent storytelling. Through the interaction of the player's decisions, oracular mechanics, and narrative prompts, a complex and evolving story unfolds, driven by the player’s creativity and the game's inherent unpredictability.

## Core Principles

*Loner: Grand Strategy* follows the following design principles:

1. **Faction Dynamics**: Every faction you control has unique goals, traits, and challenges, creating tension and diversity in play.
2. **Oracular Decisions**: Dice rolls resolve uncertainty and introduce twists, ensuring dynamic outcomes.
3. **Emergent Storytelling**: Your choices and dice results shape the narrative organically. This means the narrative isn’t predetermined but arises naturally from the player’s choices, random outcomes, and the interactions between factions.
4. **Comprehensive Solo Tools**: Intuitive tables, prompts, and mechanics make the game smooth and self-sufficient.

## What You Need to Play

- **Four six-sided dice** (d6): Two of one color (Chance Dice) and two of another (Risk Dice).
- **Notebook or journal**: To record factions, key events, and outcomes.
- **Reference sheet**: For quick access to tables and rules.
- **Writing tools**: Pens, pencils, or digital note-taking apps.

### Quick Start

If you’re ready to dive into *Loner: Grand Strategy* and want a fast setup, follow these steps to get started quickly:

1. **Pick Your Factions**: Choose 4-6 factions, defining their names, concepts, skills, frailties, assets, goals, and motives. Use the faction creation templates to streamline this process.  
   Example: *Ironbound Enclave (Resilient Mining Collective)* with the goal of overthrowing the local aristocracy.

2. **Define the Time Frame**: Decide how many turns the game will span and the in-game duration each turn represents.
   Example: A 10-turn campaign where each turn equals one month, representing a year-long conflict.

3. **Set Goals**: Write down the goals for each faction, ensuring they align with the setting’s core conflict and create tension between factions.
   Example: *The Gilded Lords aim to control three trade hubs, while the Ravenwatch Syndicate seeks to undermine all dominant powers.*

4. **Start the First Turn**:
   - **Player-Controlled Faction**: Define your faction’s objective and build an argument based on its traits. Resolve the action using the Oracle system.
   - **AI-Controlled Factions**: For each AI faction, determine their intent, choose a target, and build their arguments. Resolve each action sequentially with the Oracle system.

That’s it! The game is now underway. Let the factions’ actions and the Oracle’s twists guide the evolving story.

## Setting Creation

### Step 1: Define the World

Start by crafting a compelling and dynamic world where the factions will vie for power. Consider the following aspects to build a rich and engaging backdrop:

- **Era and Technology**: Decide the technological and historical framework of your setting. This determines the tone and possibilities within the world.
- **Core Conflict**: Identify the main tension that drives faction interactions. This central conflict will anchor the narrative and give factions their purpose.
- **Unique Features**: Highlight distinctive elements that make the world memorable and offer creative opportunities for storytelling.

As you define the world, aim for a balance of familiar elements to ground the setting and unique features to capture the imagination. Let the factions’ goals and conflicts emerge naturally from this foundation.

### Step 2: Map Key Locations

Create a map of 6-8 major locations that serve as key hubs or points of interest in your world. Each location should have distinct characteristics that influence faction interactions and gameplay. Follow these steps to ensure each location contributes meaningfully to the narrative and strategic depth of your setting:

#### **1. Define the Type of Location**
Decide what role the location plays in the world. Use a mix of these archetypes to add variety:
- **Political Centers**: Capitals or strongholds where power is concentrated.
- **Economic Hubs**: Cities or regions focused on trade, resource production, or wealth.
- **Cultural Landmarks**: Places of artistic, religious, or historical significance.
- **Strategic Locations**: Fortresses, choke points, or territories critical to military or logistical plans.
- **Uncharted Frontiers**: Wild or unexplored areas filled with risks and opportunities.
- **Neutral Zones**: Common grounds where factions negotiate or compete under uneasy truces.

#### **2. Add Unique Traits**
Ensure each location has defining features that make it memorable and relevant. Consider:
- **Physical Traits**: Geography, climate, or architecture (e.g., a desert oasis, a labyrinthine underground city).
- **Population and Society**: The type of people or creatures that inhabit the area (e.g., a nomadic tribe, sentient machines).
- **Special Resources**: Rare materials, artifacts, or natural phenomena found only in that location.
- **Local Challenges**: Hazards or obstacles unique to the area, such as hostile wildlife, cursed lands, or treacherous terrain.

#### **3. Assign Faction Relevance**
Determine how each faction views or interacts with the location:
- Is the location controlled by a faction, contested, or independent?
- What does each faction stand to gain or lose here?
- Are there hidden elements (e.g., secrets, alliances, or spies) that might affect faction dynamics?

#### **4. Name and Describe Each Location**
Give each location a descriptive name and write a short summary highlighting its significance. For example:
- **The Gilded Spires**: A glittering metropolis ruled by merchant lords, famous for its extravagant markets and hidden criminal underworld.
- **Shardfall Canyon**: A remote ravine littered with ancient, glowing crystals coveted by all factions but guarded by feral creatures.
- **The Hollow Keep**: A crumbling fortress perched on a misty cliff, rumored to house powerful relics from a forgotten age.

#### **5. Sketch Relationships Between Locations**
Establish how the locations are connected geographically, economically, or politically:
- **Proximity**: Are locations close and easily accessible, or isolated and challenging to reach?
- **Trade Routes**: Which locations rely on one another for resources or commerce?
- **Conflict Zones**: Are there areas where factions frequently clash due to their strategic or symbolic value?

#### **6. Add Gameplay Elements**
Infuse each location with gameplay hooks or opportunities for emergent storytelling:
- What risks and rewards do factions face when attempting to control or explore this location?
- Are there events or challenges tied to the location, such as festivals, disasters, or seasonal changes?
- Could the location trigger twists in the story, such as uncovering hidden relics or sparking new conflicts?

### Example Locations

1. **Ironmark Citadel**: A mountain fortress with impenetrable walls, vital to controlling nearby trade routes.
2. **Azure Flats**: A sprawling salt flat dotted with geysers of rare minerals, contested by miners and raiders.
3. **Eldertree Basin**: A lush valley centered around a massive, ancient tree said to grant wisdom to those who protect it.
4. **Blackwater Marsh**: A foreboding swamp filled with toxic waters and legendary beasts, rumored to hide immense treasures.
5. **Veilport**: A neutral coastal city where smugglers and diplomats coexist in uneasy harmony.
6. **Stormreach Plateau**: A high-altitude desert where violent electrical storms occur, providing energy sources but posing great danger.

### Step 3: Create Factions

Use the template below to define each faction. Aim for 4-6 factions with varied motivations:

- **Name**: The name should stand out and be consistent with the setting's tone. Think evocative titles like *“The Gilded Lords”* or *“The Ironbound Enclave.”*
- **Concept**: A concise description of the faction’s identity, purpose, or theme. Pair an adjective and a noun for a striking combination, like *“Ambitious Merchant Guild”* or *“Resilient Mining Collective.”*
- **Skills** (x2): Unique strengths or specialties that set the faction apart. These should be descriptive and situational, like *“Master Traders”* or *“Deep Earth Lore.”*
- **Frailty**: A notable weakness that limits the faction’s effectiveness or creates vulnerabilities. Examples include *“Politically Naïve”* or *“Internal Divisions.”*
- **Assets** (x2): Tangible or intangible resources the faction wields. Avoid generic items; instead, specify distinctive traits, such as *“Fortified Mines”* or *“Ancient Spell Tomes.”*
- **Goal**: The faction’s ultimate aspiration or objective. Goals should drive the faction’s actions, like *“Control the Eastern Trade Routes”* or *“Overthrow the Local Aristocracy.”*
- **Motive**: The underlying reason the faction pursues its goal. This adds depth and rationale to their actions, such as *“To secure independence”* or *“To restore a lost legacy.”*
- **Nemesis**: A constant challenge that thwarts the faction, such as a rival organization, an external threat, or even internal strife. For example, *“The Gilded Lords”* or *“A Corrupt Leader.”*

These **traits** define the faction qualitatively, serving as narrative tools rather than quantitative measures. They allow for flexibility and creativity in storytelling, ensuring each faction feels distinct and integral to the game world.

#### Example Faction
**Name**: Ironbound Enclave  
**Concept**: Resilient mining collective  
**Skills**: Unyielding Labor, Deep Earth Lore  
**Frailty**: Politically Naïve  
**Assets**: Fortified Mines, Rare Gem Deposits  
**Goal**: Overthrow local aristocracy to secure independence  
**Motive**: Freedom from exploitation  
**Nemesis**: The Gilded Lords (aristocracy)

| 6   | Naval Superiority | Sprawling City-State| Advanced Intelligence| Ancient Libraries| Technological Wonders | Mobile Headquarters |

### **Step 4: Define the Goals**
Each faction should have a clear **Goal** that serves as their ultimate objective. Goals provide motivation for their actions and create tension as they compete or collaborate to achieve their aims. Follow these steps to define the goals for each faction:

1. **Align with the Core Conflict**: Goals should connect directly to the main tension of the setting, such as resource control, territorial dominance, or ideological supremacy.
2. **Make Goals Specific and Measurable**: Avoid vague ambitions. Instead, craft goals that are tangible and achievable within the game’s scope.
   - Example: *“Secure control of three key trade routes”* or *“Destroy the opposing coalition”*.
3. **Establish Rivalries and Overlaps**: Ensure some faction goals are complementary or opposing to encourage interaction. For instance:
   - *Faction A’s goal is to dominate the desert trade routes.*
   - *Faction B’s goal is to maintain independence by disrupting trade monopolies.*

### **Step 5: Define the Time Frame**
The game’s time frame limits the number of turns and sets a narrative pace, creating urgency and driving factions toward their goals.

1. **Set a Finite Number of Turns**: Decide how many turns the game will span, based on the desired depth and complexity:
   - **Short Campaign**: 6-8 turns for a concise, focused narrative.
   - **Medium Campaign**: 10-12 turns for moderate complexity and interaction.
   - **Long Campaign**: 15+ turns for expansive, layered storytelling.
   
2. **Establish the In-Game Time Frame**: Determine the in-game duration that corresponds to the turns. This could represent days, weeks, months, or even years, depending on the setting.
   - Example: In a medieval fantasy world, each turn might represent a season, spanning three years over 12 turns.
   - Example: In a sci-fi setting, each turn might represent a month, covering a year-long interstellar conflict.

3. **Connect to Faction Goals**: Ensure the time frame aligns with the plausibility of achieving the goals:
   - Large-scale goals like conquering an empire may need a long campaign.
   - Smaller objectives, such as securing alliances, can fit into a short game.

### **Recording Goals and Time Frame**

Document the goals and time frame in your game journal or setup notes. Use a summary format like this:

> - **Campaign Length**: 10 turns, representing 10 months.
> - **Faction Goals**:
>   - *Ironbound Enclave*: Secure independence by capturing two mining colonies.
>   - *Gilded Lords*: Control three major trade hubs to monopolize commerce.
>   - *Ravenwatch Syndicate*: Undermine the power of rival factions through espionage and sabotage.
>   - *Emerald Dominion*: Spread their influence by converting two factions to their ideology.


### Sample Scenario: Ashes of the Rift

> A once-stable region lies in turmoil after a cataclysmic arcane event tore a dimensional rift into the heartland. Ancient power struggles flare anew, trade routes collapse, and belief systems fracture. Three emergent factions now compete for control over what remains.

### Faction 1: The Ember League
- **Assets**: Flame-Sworn Paladins, Rift-Metal Foundries
- **Skill**: Tactical Fire Control
- **Frailty**: Over-reliant on unstable Rift energy
- **Goal**: Establish a militarized theocracy centered on the Rift

### Faction 2: The Verdant Concord
- **Assets**: Network of Root-Kin Agents, Mycelial Archives
- **Skill**: Deep Ecological Memory
- **Frailty**: Isolationist doctrine limits diplomacy
- **Goal**: Restore balance and seal the Rift through ancient rites

### Faction 3: The Broken Syndic
- **Assets**: Black Market Portals, Disgraced Nobles, Espionage Guilds
- **Skill**: Smuggling and Manipulation
- **Frailty**: Infighting among rogue houses
- **Goal**: Exploit the chaos to rebuild their shattered empire

### Starting Situation
- A surge of Rift energy has destabilized the once-neutral city of Kharan’s Spire.
- Each faction moves to influence or claim it before the anomaly widens.
- Roll a **World Event** at game start and resolve one faction argument each before Turn 1.


## Gameplay

In *Loner: Grand Strategy*, gameplay unfolds over structured turns, each representing a key moment in the evolving narrative. During each turn, factions take actions to pursue their goals, react to events, and shape the world. The process is divided into four phases, ensuring a balance of strategy, storytelling, and unpredictability. Let the Oracle guide outcomes, and use the factions’ traits to weave a dynamic and engaging story.

### Phase 1: Planning the Turn

Each turn represents a major scene or period in the unfolding story. During each turn, both the player-controlled faction and the AI-controlled factions act sequentially. Follow these steps:

#### **Step 1: Player-Controlled Faction**

1. **Define the Objective**: Decide what your faction aims to accomplish this turn. Use its Goal, Assets, and narrative circumstances as inspiration. For example, a faction focused on expanding influence might target a trade route, while a defensive faction might bolster its stronghold.

2. **Build the Argument**: Present your faction’s planned action as an argument, using its Skills, Assets, and the current situation to justify success.  
   - Arguments should feel logical and grounded in the narrative.  
   - Example: *The Ironbound Enclave attempts to sabotage the Gilded Lords’ supply chain using their Unyielding Labor and Deep Earth Lore.*

#### **Step 2: AI-Controlled Factions**

For each AI-controlled faction, follow these steps:

1. **Determine Intent**: Roll 1d6 on the **Intent Table** to decide the faction's primary focus for the turn. This defines whether the faction acts defensively, offensively, diplomatically, or opportunistically.
   - Example: A roll of 5 on the Intent Table indicates a diplomatic action, such as forming alliances or negotiating terms.

| **Intent Table** (1d6) | **Intent**          | **Example**                                |
|-------------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1-2                    | Defensive          | Protecting territory, reinforcing defenses.|
| 3-4                    | Offensive          | Attacking rivals, expanding influence.     |
| 5                      | Diplomatic         | Forming alliances, negotiating treaties.   |
| 6                      | Opportunistic      | Exploiting resources, taking advantage of events.|

2. **Choose a Target**: Determine the AI faction’s target using its Goal, relationships, or random rolls:
   - Favor factions or locations that align with the AI’s narrative objectives.
   - Example: A rival faction threatening their territory, or a key resource nearby.

3. **Build the Argument**: Present the AI faction’s action as an argument, using its Skills, Assets, and Frailty to justify the attempt:
   - Example: *The Gilded Lords use their Master Negotiators Skill and Trade Coalition Asset to forge an alliance against the Ironbound Enclave.*

#### How to Build an Argument
At the heart of _Loner: Grand Strategy_ is the act of presenting an argument: describing what a faction is trying to do and why it might succeed. 

Use this repeatable template when stating any action:

**[Faction] uses [Asset or Skill] to [Intent] because [Justification].**
- **Intent** is what the faction wants to achieve (attack, ally, seize land, etc.)
- **Asset/Skill** is what supports the attempt (e.g., Elite Army, Spy Network)
- **Justification** is your rationale — the story logic

**Examples:**

- *The Ravenwatch Syndicate uses their Hidden Networks to infiltrate the merchant council because the trade war weakens defenses.*
- *The Gilded Lords use their Master Negotiators to forge an alliance because the Ironbound Enclave threatens the coast.*
- *The Emerald Dominion uses its Prophets to incite rebellion in the east because the population shares their faith.*

This structure helps you argue clearly and makes Oracle rolls more meaningful.

#### Optional: Minimalist AI Turn Shortcut

*(Use this only if you want to speed up large campaigns)*

Instead of resolving each AI turn with full argument logic, roll **1d6** on the following table and narrate a brief action accordingly. This shortcut skips explicit trait-based arguments.

| d6 | AI Faction Action Summary                             |
| -- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 1  | Fortifies or defends a vulnerable asset or location   |
| 2  | Expands territory or claims a neutral resource        |
| 3  | Undermines a rival with sabotage or espionage         |
| 4  | Negotiates with another faction for alliance or trade |
| 5  | Exploits a recent event or environmental change       |
| 6  | Pursues a surprising side goal or pivots unexpectedly |

* Use the faction’s **goal and frailty** to color the outcome.
* Skip full argument justification; go straight to Oracle resolution.
* Ideal for **background factions** or **quick multi-faction scenes**.

#### Note on Asymmetric Factions
Factions in _Loner: Grand Strategy_ are not designed to be balanced opponents.

Some may dominate the map through strong assets and momentum; others may stagnate, implode, or collapse due to frailty rolls, world events, or failed arguments.

This asymmetry is a feature, not a flaw: it creates a dynamic strategic world where power shifts naturally, alliances are reactive, and no faction is protected from downfall.

Embrace this variability — it’s what makes each campaign unique.

### Phase 2: Resolve the Action

Once the arguments are build, you ask the Oracle to determine the action's outcome.

You’ll need 2d6 in one color (**Chance Dice**), and 2d6 in another (**Risk Dice**).

To resolve a closed question, roll one **Chance Die** and one **Risk Die**:
- If the Chance Die is highest, the answer is **Yes**. 
- If the Risk Die is highest, the answer is **No**.
- If both are low (3 or less), add a **but...**. 
- If both are high (4 or more), add an **and...**.
- If both are equal, the answer is **Yes, and...**. Add a point to the **[Twist Counter](#twist-counter)**.


| Dice Value |    Chance Die > Risk Die   | Risk Die > Chance Die |
|:----------:|:--------------------------:|:---------------------:|
|  Both < 4  |         Yes, but...        |       No, but...      |
|  Both > 3  |         Yes, and...        |       No, and...      |
| Mismatched |             Yes            |           No          |
|            |                            |                       |
|    Equal   | Add 1 to the Twist Counter |                       |

#### Interpreting “Yes, but…” and “No, and…”

Some Oracle outcomes (like **“Yes, but…”** or **“No, and…”**) invite interpretation. Use these suggestions to guide your storytelling:

* **Yes, but...** 
  The action succeeds, *but at a cost or with a drawback*.  
  *Example*: “The Enclave secures the outpost, **but** it’s damaged beyond immediate use.”

* **No, and...** 
  The action fails, *and things get worse*.
  *Example*: “The Syndicate fails to intercept the convoy, **and** their spy is exposed and captured.”

* **Yes, and...** 
  The action succeeds *with extra benefit*.
  *Example*: “The Gilded Lords broker a trade deal, **and** gain access to a secret shipping lane.”

* **No, but...** 
  The action fails *but there’s a silver lining*.
  *Example*: “The Dominion’s envoy is turned away, **but** they learn about internal divisions in the rival court.”

These interpretations help move the narrative forward while keeping outcomes dynamic and story-rich.

#### Advantage and Disadvantage

If circumstances or positive tags grant an advantage, add a **Chance Die** to the roll. Otherwise, when hindrances or negative tag cause a disadvantage, add a **Risk Die**. In both cases keep only the higher die of the added type when you check the roll.

Consider tags **intuitively and not quantitatively**, using the context of the situation at play. It is important to keep the flow of play fast and not accounting for advantages and disadvantages numerically!

#### Twist Counter

The Twist Counter is a measure of the rising tension in the narrative. At the beginning is set to 0. Every time a double throw (dice are equal) happens, add 1 to the Counter. If the Counter is below three, consider the answer as "**Yes, but...**". Otherwise a **Twist** happens and resets the Counter.

Roll 2d6 and consult the following Twist Table to determine what kind of twist happens. 

| D6  | Subject             | Action                 |
|-----|---------------------|------------------------|
|  1  | A third party       | Intervenes            |
|  2  | The environment     | Changes dramatically  |
|  3  | A key figure        | Betrays their allies  |
|  4  | A hidden truth      | Is revealed           |
|  5  | Resources           | Become scarce         |
|  6  | An unexpected event | Ends the turn        |

#### **Tips for Interpreting Results**
- **Keep the Narrative Moving**: Whether actions succeed or fail, ensure the results add new layers of intrigue or tension to the story.
- **AI Behavior Adjustments**: If an AI faction’s intent or target seems illogical for the context, adjust its action to align better with its traits and goals.

### Phase 3: Record and Reflect

At the end of each turn:
- Update the faction’s status (e.g., new Assets, depleted resources, modified Goals).
- Note significant events or emerging storylines.

### Phase 4: Determine the mood of the next turn

At the end of the current turn sometimes you will be clear about the direction to take, other times you may need to determine the general mood of the next one. In this case roll 1d6 and consult the following table:

|  D6 |   Next Turn   |
|:---:|:--------------:|
| 1-3 | Dramatic |
| 4-5 |   Quiet  |
|  6  |   Meanwhile…   |

- A **dramatic turn** maintains the tension from the previous events, pushing the narrative forward with new obstacles or escalating conflicts.  
- During a **quiet turn**, factions regroup, recover, and plan their next moves, providing a pause before further action.  
- A **meanwhile turn** shifts the focus to another faction or location, revealing actions or events occurring elsewhere in the game world.  

### Ending the Game

The game concludes when:

- **A faction achieves its Goal**, bringing their storyline to a natural conclusion.
- **Last turn ends**, even if the final outcome is status quo.
- **A key storyline resolves**, such as the end of a war, the collapse of a dominant power, or the prevention (or realization) of a major calamity.

### Bringing the Story to a Close

At the end of the game, take time to reflect on the journey and provide a satisfying narrative closure. Use the following steps to tie together the factions’ stories and the broader world:

#### 1. **Summarize Faction Journeys**
- For each faction, describe their successes, setbacks, and ultimate impact on the world.
- Highlight pivotal moments or conflicts that defined their story.
- **Example**:  
  - *Ironbound Enclave*: “Secured independence after defeating the Gilded Lords in a final confrontation, though their resources were depleted in the process.”  
  - *Ravenwatch Syndicate*: “Quietly amassed power through espionage and black-market operations, becoming a shadowy but dominant force.”

#### 2. **Resolve Unfinished Threads**
- Identify unresolved goals or conflicts. These can serve as inspiration for future campaigns.
- Ask: *What ambitions remain unfulfilled? What rivalries might reignite?*
- **Example**:  
  - The Emerald Dominion’s attempts to convert a rival faction failed, leaving an uneasy peace with tensions simmering beneath the surface.

#### 3. **World Impact**
- Consider how the factions’ actions have shaped the world.
- Has the balance of power shifted? Are alliances stronger or weaker? Did new threats emerge?
- **Example**:  
  - “The Glittering Coast, once a thriving trade hub, now lies in ruins after years of conflict. The region is ripe for new powers to rise.”

### **Prompts for Reflection**
Use these prompts to help summarize and expand on the game’s conclusion:
- **Factions**:
  - *Which faction had the most significant victory?*
  - *Which faction suffered the greatest loss?*
  - *Did any faction change their goals or identity during the game?*
- **World**:
  - *How has the setting evolved as a result of the factions’ actions?*
  - *What regions or locations have changed hands or been destroyed?*
  - *Are there new opportunities or dangers in the aftermath of the game?*
- **Future Campaigns**:
  - *What unresolved threads could spark the next story?*
  - *Could a defeated faction rise again with new tactics?*
  - *Has a new power emerged, ready to challenge the established order?*

### Example Ending Narrative

*"The year-long trade war for the Glittering Coast ended in chaos. The Ironbound Enclave secured control of the trade routes, but at the cost of alienating former allies. The Gilded Lords, once dominant, retreated to their capital, plotting revenge. Meanwhile, the Ravenwatch Syndicate quietly extended their influence, ensuring the region’s instability works to their advantage. The Glittering Coast is left fractured, its future uncertain but full of possibility."*

### Conflicts

A *Conflict* in a Matrix Game represents the friction between factions as they clash over resources, power, or ideology. These conflicts can involve direct confrontations or indirect challenges like political maneuvering, espionage, or economic strategies. They are essential to driving the game’s narrative and creating dynamic interactions between factions.

### **Types of Conflicts**

Conflicts are flexible and adapt to the narrative context. Here are some common scenarios:
- **Military Engagements**: Battles, sieges, or skirmishes where factions deploy their forces.
- **Diplomatic Rivalries**: Competing factions attempting to sway a neutral party or secure an alliance.
- **Resource Struggles**: Contests over control of vital resources like trade routes, mines, or agricultural zones.
- **Ideological Clashes**: Propaganda wars, cultural influence, or philosophical debates.
- **Economic Wars**: Undermining a rival faction’s economy through sabotage, monopolies, or disruption.

### **Resolving Conflicts**

#### **Method 1: Single Closed Question**
Pose a decisive Yes/No question to the Oracle to resolve the conflict in one step. This method works best for smaller or less complex conflicts.
- Example: *“Does the Ironbound Enclave succeed in defending their mining outpost from the Gilded Lords?”*

#### **Method 2: Series of Closed Questions**
Break the conflict into smaller stages, resolving each action with its own Oracle question. This method is ideal for complex or multi-faction conflicts.
- Example: *“Do the Gilded Lords’ forces breach the outpost defenses?”* followed by *“Can the Ironbound Enclave’s reinforcements arrive in time?”*

#### **Method 3: Narrated Interaction**
For conflicts involving multiple factions or simultaneous objectives, narrate the sequence of actions while resolving key points with Oracle rolls. Each faction’s actions and responses shape the unfolding story.

### **Multi-Faction Conflict Example: A Trade War**

#### **Setup**
Three factions are vying for control of a lucrative trade hub, *The Glittering Coast*:
- **Ironbound Enclave**: Seeks to secure the hub to fund their rebellion.
- **Gilded Lords**: Aim to monopolize the trade routes for economic dominance.
- **Ravenwatch Syndicate**: Exploits the conflict for espionage and black market gains.

#### **Sequence**
1. **Ironbound Enclave’s Turn**: The player-controlled faction argues for a diplomatic alliance with local merchants to secure influence.
   - *Argument*: *“Using our Deep Earth Lore to promise better mining deals, we sway the merchants to our side.”*
   - *Oracle Result*: *Yes, but...* The merchants agree, but the Gilded Lords increase tariffs to counter this advantage.
   
2. **Gilded Lords’ Turn (AI)**: Roll for intent, resulting in an offensive action to undermine the Enclave.
   - *Action*: The Lords deploy their trade fleet to blockade shipments from the Enclave-controlled mines.
   - *Oracle Result*: *No, and...* The blockade fails due to bad weather, and the Syndicate capitalizes by smuggling goods through a secret route.

3. **Ravenwatch Syndicate’s Turn (AI)**: Their intent is opportunistic, focusing on expanding their influence amid the chaos.
   - *Action*: *“Use our Hidden Networks to infiltrate the merchant council and sabotage negotiations between the Enclave and the Lords.”*
   - *Oracle Result*: *Yes, and...* The Syndicate gains a foothold in the council and uncovers sensitive trade data from both factions.

#### **Outcome**
After one round, tensions escalate. The Enclave secures some influence but faces economic retaliation. The Gilded Lords’ failed blockade damages their reputation, while the Syndicate emerges with new leverage. The conflict continues into the next turn, shaped by these results.

### **Conflicts Between AI Factions**

When AI factions clash, the player narrates their actions and outcomes, guided by the Oracle. Follow these steps:
1. **Determine Intent**: Roll for each faction’s intent using the Intent Table or align it with their goals.
2. **Present Arguments**: Based on their Skills and Assets, craft an argument for each faction’s action.
3. **Resolve Actions**: Use the Oracle to determine the outcome of each faction’s argument.
4. **Interpret Results**: Narrate the consequences, ensuring the narrative remains consistent and engaging.

**Example**:  
The **Emerald Dominion** seeks to spread their influence into the Syndicate’s territory through religious conversions. The Syndicate responds by deploying their Hidden Networks to expose the Dominion’s covert operatives. The Oracle rolls result in a partial success for both, with the Syndicate delaying the Dominion’s efforts but suffering public backlash.

### **Consequences and Context**

Every conflict should leave a mark on the game’s narrative:
- **Victory**: A faction achieves its objective, gaining new resources, alliances, or territory.
- **Defeat**: A faction faces setbacks, such as losing control of resources, suffering reputation damage, or retreating.
- **Escalation**: Even successful actions may spark new rivalries, introduce unforeseen challenges, or shift alliances.

### Optional: Quick Conflict Resolution for AI Factions

When multiple AI factions are engaged in a conflict and you want to resolve the outcome quickly without narrating step-by-step actions, use this method:

1. Roll 1d6 for **each faction involved** and consult the table below.
2. Compare results to determine relative advantage.
3. Use a single Oracle roll to resolve the decisive moment, adjusting based on who had the upper hand in step 1.

| d6 | AI Conflict Posture (Narrative Advantage)                   |
|----|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | Disorganized – suffers internal strife or delays            |
| 2  | Defensive – focused on holding territory or resources       |
| 3  | Aggressive – launches a bold attack or risky maneuver       |
| 4  | Strategic – uses assets or alliances to shape the battle    |
| 5  | Opportunistic – exploits terrain or rival weaknesses        |
| 6  | Coordinated – executes a high-efficiency plan               |

Then resolve with the Oracle as usual, narrating the result based on momentum, resources, and faction goals. This shortcut preserves dramatic flow without the full argument structure.


###  Map Integration

#### **Using a Map and Tokens**

Adding a map and tokens to *Loner: Grand Strategy* provides a visual way to track faction movements, resource control, and key events. This optional tool can be adapted for simplicity or complexity based on your preference.

#### **Minimalist Setup**

1. **Sketch the Map**:
   - Draw a rough outline of the game world with a few key locations, such as capitals, trade hubs, or resource zones.
   - Keep it simple and focused on areas relevant to faction goals.

2. **Use Simple Tokens**:
   - Use coins, dice, or small objects to represent faction presence.
   - Place tokens on controlled locations or move them to represent actions during gameplay.

3. **Track Broad Movements**:
   - Shift tokens between locations to reflect faction actions, such as expansions, alliances, or conflicts.
   - Annotate key changes (e.g., a contested trade route or a new alliance) directly on the map.

#### **Advanced Setup**

1. **Design a Detailed Map**:
   - Create a map with geographical features like mountains, rivers, or deserts.
   - Mark locations such as fortresses, trade routes, and resource zones.

2. **Assign Faction Territories**:
   - Use color coding or unique symbols to indicate areas controlled by factions.
   - Highlight contested zones or strategic points of interest.

3. **Use Tokens and Markers**:
   - Represent factions with tokens, miniatures, or counters.
   - Add markers for contested zones, destroyed resources, or achieved objectives.

4. **Incorporate Gameplay Elements**:
   - Let the map shape faction strategies, influencing decisions based on proximity or resource availability.
   - Use environmental features (e.g., mountains or rivers) as narrative obstacles or advantages.

#### Example Use

- **Map**: A rough outline with key locations:
  - *Ironspire Citadel*: A stronghold controlled by the Ironbound Enclave.
  - *The Glittering Coast*: A trade hub contested by multiple factions.
  - *Crimson Veil Mountains*: A dangerous area with valuable resources.
  
- **Tokens**:
  - Each faction has a token to represent their presence.
  - Additional tokens mark contested zones or key resources.

### The Leader

The **Leader Rule** introduces faction leaders as key figures who can influence the game by granting their faction additional actions during their turn. Leaders follow the classic character format from *Loner*, with unique traits that enhance the narrative and strategic depth of the game.

#### **How It Works**

1. **Determine Leader Activity**:
   - At the start of a faction’s turn, roll 1d6 to check if their leader is active.
   - On a result of **4-6**, the leader is active and grants the faction a **free action** for that turn.

2. **Free Action**:
   - This action is in addition to the faction’s regular action.
   - The free action must align with the leader’s **Skills**, **Gear**, or **Goal**.
   - Example: A leader with the Skill *Master Diplomat* might initiate a diplomatic negotiation, while a leader with *Tactical Genius* could plan a military maneuver.

3. **Leader Traits**: Leaders use the following character format, which defines their strengths, weaknesses, and narrative hooks.

#### **Leader Character Format**

| Field          | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Name**       | The leader’s name. Should be distinctive and consistent with the setting.   |
| **Concept**    | A concise descriptor of the leader’s identity (e.g., *“Ruthless Strategist”*). |
| **Skills**     | Two unique abilities or traits that define their expertise.                 |
| **Frailty**    | A notable weakness or vulnerability.                                        |
| **Gear**       | Two pieces of unique equipment that complement their Skills or concept.     |
| **Goal**       | The leader’s personal long-term ambition.                                   |
| **Motive**     | What drives the leader to pursue their Goal.                                |
| **Nemesis**    | A rival or persistent challenge to the leader’s plans.                      |
| **Luck**       | Starts at 6 and is reduced during conflicts; recharges when the conflict ends. |

#### **Adding Leaders to Factions**

Each faction can have one leader assigned at the start of the game or introduced during gameplay. Leaders act as narrative drivers, representing the faction’s ambitions and adding a personal stake to their actions.

1. **Assign a Leader**:
   - Use the character creation format to define the leader’s traits.
   - Ensure the leader’s **Skills**, **Goal**, and **Motive** align with the faction’s overall identity.

2. **Leader Sheets**:
   - Maintain a separate sheet for each leader, tracking their Luck, actions, and narrative developments.

#### **Example Leader**

**Name**: Marshal Kael Drakmar  
**Concept**: Ruthless Strategist  
**Skills**: Tactical Genius, Master Negotiator  
**Frailty**: Overly Ambitious  
**Gear**: Signal Relic (enhances communication across the battlefield), Encrypted Journal (contains strategic plans)  
**Goal**: Secure domination over contested trade routes.  
**Motive**: To cement their legacy as a peerless tactician.  
**Nemesis**: Captain Mira Ashenvale, leader of the rival Ravenwatch Syndicate.  
**Luck**: 6

#### **Strategic Use of Leaders**

- **Enhancing Gameplay**:
  - Leaders can shape the direction of a faction’s actions, providing players with opportunities for creative and impactful moves.
  - Their activation introduces unpredictability, keeping the narrative dynamic.

- **Conflict Resolution**:
  - Leaders can participate directly in conflicts, using their **Skills** and **Gear** to influence outcomes.
  - If a leader is central to a faction’s free action, their **Luck** may come into play during Oracle rolls.

- **Narrative Depth**:
  - Incorporate the leader’s **Goal**, **Motive**, and **Nemesis** into the story to enrich faction interactions.
  - Example: A leader might broker a fragile alliance, only for their Nemesis to sabotage it in a later turn.

#### **Leader Activation Table**

| Roll | Leader Status            |
|------|--------------------------|
| 1-3  | Leader is unavailable.   |
| 4-6  | Leader is active. A free action is granted. |

### Solo Player Tips

#### **7. Focus on Emergent Storytelling**
- Think of yourself as both the player and the storyteller. Use the factions’ actions and results to build a cohesive and evolving narrative.
- Let the setting and goals guide the story, but don’t be afraid to adapt based on what unfolds.

### **8. Use Prompts for Inspiration**
- If you encounter a creative block, roll on the verb, noun, and adjective tables for quick inspiration.
- Example Prompt Result: *“Reveal an ancient secret.”*  
  - Interpretation: “A long-lost treaty surfaces, reigniting an old alliance that reshapes the balance of power.”

#### **9. Celebrate the Journey**
- Solo games are personal experiences—enjoy the process of crafting a unique world and story.
- Take a moment at the end of the game to reflect on what you’ve created and how the factions evolved.

## Record Sheets

### **Faction Record Sheet**

| Field           | Description                                                              |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Name**        | The faction’s name.                                                      |

## Appendix: Quick Reference Summary

### Game Loop: Turn Structure

Each turn has three phases:

**Phase 1: Player Turn**

1. Choose a faction.
2. Build an argument:
   *"\[Faction] uses \[Asset or Skill] to \[Intent] because \[Justification]."*
3. Roll the Oracle to resolve.
4. Narrate consequences and update the world.

**Phase 2: AI-Controlled Factions**

1. Roll **Intent** (1d6).
2. Choose target (goal, map, or random).
3. Build argument using Assets, Skills, Frailty.
4. Roll the Oracle and narrate outcomes.

> Optional: use **Minimalist AI Turn Shortcut** or **Quick Conflict Method** if playing fast.

**Phase 3: World Events**

* Roll for **Environmental Disruption**, **Economic Shift**, or a **Story Twist**.
* Apply effects and narrate impact.

### Oracle Table (Roll 1d6)

Roll **one Chance d6** and **one Risk d6** (different colours).
Compare the two dice and consult the grid:

|                                | **Risk die is higher**                     | **Chance die is higher** |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| **Both dice ≤ 3**              | **No, but…**                               | **Yes, but…**            |
| **Both dice ≥ 4**              | **No, and…**                               | **Yes, and…**            |
| **Numbers differ (< 4 & ≥ 4)** | **No**                                     | **Yes**                  |
| **Both dice equal**            | **Yes, and…** & add 1 to **Twist Counter** |                          |

### Random Table Index

| Table Category                | Use Case                        |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Faction Actions**           | AI faction turn intent          |
| **Faction Shifts**            | Internal changes to a faction   |
| **Diplomatic Events**         | Changing relationships          |
| **Environmental Disruptions** | Global or regional changes      |

* **Conflict Options**:

  * Single Oracle Question
  * Series of Oracle Questions
  * Narrated Interaction
