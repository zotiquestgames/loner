# Loner: Pulp Heroes

***Loner: Pulp Heroes*** is a solo tabletop RPG adventure set in the shadow-drenched streets and smoke-choked cities of the 1930s, where masked vigilantes wage a relentless war against crime and corruption.

This minimalist Solo Role Playing Game is designed to plunge you into the dark heart of pulp heroism, where justice comes at the end of a gun and the only law that matters is the one you enforce yourself.

## Introduction

*Loner: Pulp Heroes* follows the following design principles:

1. **Portable**: to play you will need a few common (six-sided) dice and writing materials. Anything else is optional and not essential.
2. **Rules-Light**: the game relies on a few rules and only one solving mechanic, easy to learn and eventually to memorize.
3. **Tag-based**: characters and situations are defined only by qualitative descriptors and no quantitative characteristics.

With a focus on quick resolutions, **Loner: Pulp Heroes** throws you headfirst into the heart of noir action. Your character will be defined by thematic tags like *Shadow Walker*, *Truth Serum*, *Ruthless*, and *Twin .45s*.

### What is a Role Playing Game (RPG)?
A role-playing game (RPG) is a type of game in which players assume the roles of fictional characters and act out their actions and decisions within a narrative or imaginary setting. The outcome of these actions and decisions is often determined by a set of rules and game mechanics, such as dice rolls or statistical attributes of the characters. Players may also collaborate to create a shared story or narrative through their characters' actions and interactions.

### What is a Solo RPG?

In a solo RPG a single player takes on the roles of one or more characters, while also simultaneously managing some elements of the game world. These games typically involve the use of a rule system and game mechanics to determine the outcome of actions taken by the player-controlled characters. 
Unlike a gamebook (such as the Fighting Fantasy, Lone Wolf, and Tunnels & Trolls series) a solo RPG is not a form of interactive, forked narrative in which outcomes are pre-determined and limited by the author's choices.

Through the interaction of player, oracle, tools, and prompts, the character's actions will build an **emergent narrative** within whose boundaries anything can be attempted, without predetermined limits.

### Safety Tools
You will play alone, but be sure to play in an environment that is comfortable for you, without overexerting yourself, and reserve the option to stop as soon as you feel uncomfortable for any reason, physical or emotional. Don't be afraid to tackle new themes, but do so in full awareness of your boundaries.

### Minimum Requirements
To play *Loner: Pulp Heroes* you will need:
- **4 six sided dice** (also known as d6s): two pairs of different colors
- **Paper and writing tools**: at least a sheet of scrap paper and and pencil, but index cards or sticky notes are a fine addition
- **Character sheet**: you may use the provided sheet at the back or a simple index card.
- **Notebook**: *Loner: Pulp Heroes* is not a solo journaling game, you can easily play it in the "theater of mind". But you can keep track of you game if you feel the need!

## The Dark City

The year is 1936. The Great Depression has left its mark on every street corner, but some wounds run deeper than economic hardship. In the sprawling metropolis where you operate, corruption flows like sewage through the gutters, and the line between law and lawlessness has been erased by those with enough money and influence.

• **The Concrete Jungle**: Towering skyscrapers cast permanent shadows over narrow alleys where deals are made in blood and bullets. Art Deco facades hide opium dens, speakeasies that never closed after Prohibition ended, and backroom meetings where the city's true rulers decide who lives and dies.

• **Technology of Terror**: The modern age brings new tools for both hero and villain - radio networks span the city, zeppelins patrol the skies, and experimental weapons emerge from military contracts gone wrong. But for every innovation that promises progress, ten more serve the cause of corruption.

• **The Untouchables**: Police commissioners on mob payrolls, judges who auction verdicts to the highest bidder, and politicians whose campaign promises are written in disappearing ink. The system isn't broken - it's working exactly as intended by those who bought it.

• **Desperate Citizens**: Honest folks caught between the hammer of organized crime and the anvil of corrupt authority. They've stopped believing in heroes because heroes get bought, blackmailed, or buried. They need something different - something that can't be corrupted because it never claimed to be good in the first place.

• **Occult Undercurrents**: Beneath the rational veneer of industrial progress, ancient cults and eldritch societies pull strings from the shadows. Their goals transcend mere money or power - they seek to reshape reality itself, one ritual murder at a time.

### Playable Themes

- **Vigilante Justice**: Operating outside the law because the law has been purchased
- **Dual Identity**: The constant struggle between public face and private war
- **Moral Ambiguity**: Choosing between lesser evils when there are no good options
- **Urban Gothic**: Horror that wears a three-piece suit and owns half the city
- **Pulp Action**: Over-the-top stunts, dramatic confrontations, and impossible escapes
- **Noir Investigation**: Following leads through a maze of lies, betrayal, and murder
- **Class Warfare**: The elite versus everyone else, fought in penthouses and slums
- **Occult Conspiracy**: Ancient evils using modern methods to achieve timeless goals

### Timeline

- **1929**: The Stock Market crashes, but some fortunes grow larger in the chaos
- **1930-1932**: The first masked vigilantes appear as conventional justice fails
- **1933**: The Crimson Brotherhood cult is exposed, then mysteriously forgotten
- **1934**: Police Commissioner Hayes is assassinated; his replacement is twice as corrupt
- **1935**: The Zeppelin Disaster covers up something much worse in the wreckage
- **1936**: Present day - the city bleeds, and only shadows can stop the bleeding

## Characters

In the world of *Loner: Pulp Heroes*, you are not a shining beacon of hope. You are a necessary darkness, a brutal remedy for a diseased city. Your methods are questionable, your morality is flexible, and your enemies know that encountering you means facing judgment without appeal.

### Everything is a Character!

In *Loner: Pulp Heroes* Non-Playing Characters (NPCs), Foes, Organizations, Monsters, and even relevant objects like vehicles are characters too!

Your Protagonist is described by some fixed traits:

- **Name**: The name should be iconic and consistent with the tone and setting of the story.
- **Concept**: A concise description of the character's profession, background, and abilities. The best are adjective-name pairings, like *"Merciless Mentalist"* or *"Cloaked Avenger"*.
- **Skills** (x2): Abilities not necessarily character-specific but not characteristics common to all. *"Smart"* is not a skill, *"Mind Reader"* is.
- **Frailty**: Something that could potentially get in the way of the character, either physically, mentally, or socially.
- **Gear** (x2): Particular equipment supplied to the character in coherence with the setting. Everyday items are taken for granted and do not fall under this trait.
- **Goal**: The long-term objective.
- **Motive**: What drives the pursuit of the goal.
- **Nemesis**: A person or organization that hinders the protagonist. It can emerge during the first game sessions, it may or may or not be the direct antagonist of the story, ready to appear to make life even more difficult
- **Luck**: The measure of a character's ability to avoid ill fortune or an inauspicious outcome. It applies only in Conflicts and automatically recharges when they end. Luck starts and caps at 6.

These **traits** are described by **tags**, descriptive words or phrases that can identify anything in the game world. Even the **details** of the environment in which the action moves and **conditions** (physical or mental) of the characters are tags. 

**They are qualitative representations. They are not quantitative measures.**

## Rules

*Loner: Pulp Heroes* is a minimalist Solo Role Playing Game designed to be played with only one character (the Protagonist). You'll guide them through the story that will unravel during the game, asking closed questions to an Oracle which will help you overturn your expectations.

Every now and then you will be surprised with an unexpected twist!

### Keep The Action In Motion

A game in *Loner: Pulp Heroes* is a succession of scenes. 
A scene is a unit of time in which a certain action takes place in pursuit of a certain short-term goal. 

In *Loner: Pulp Heroes* at each scene:
1. **Identify what you expect from the scene**. Compared to traits, goal, and motivation determine the Protagonist's action. What might be the reaction of the game world?
2. **Test your expectations**. When you are uncertain (or overconfident) about the reaction to your actions, [ask the Oracle](#consulting-the-oracle) a closed question (answer is Yes or No), considering the tags involved to determine if there is an [Advantage or Disadvantage](#advantage-and-disadvantage).
3. **Interpret the result**. Is the Oracle's answer in line with your expectations? If not, in the context in which the scene takes place, how should an answer that subverts them be considered?

This sequence will come to you naturally after some practice. Use it as a guideline the first few times.

### Consulting the Oracle

When you need to test your expectations you'll ask the Oracle a closed question.

You'll need 2d6 in one color (**Chance Dice**), and 2d6 in another (**Risk Dice**).

To resolve a closed question, roll one **Chance Die** and one **Risk Die**:
- If the Chance Die is highest, the answer is **Yes**. 
- If the Risk Die is highest, the answer is **No**.
- If both are low (3 or less), add a **but...**. 
- If both are high (4 or more), add an **and...**.
- If both are equal, the answer is **Yes, but...**. Add a point to the **[Twist Counter](#twist-counter)**.

| Dice Value |    Chance Die > Risk Die   | Risk Die > Chance Die |
|:----------:|:--------------------------:|:---------------------:|
|  Both < 4  |         Yes, but...        |       No, but...      |
|  Both > 3  |         Yes, and...        |       No, and...      |
| Mismatched |             Yes            |           No          |
|            |                            |                       |
|    Equal   | Add 1 to the Twist Counter |                       |

### Advantage and Disadvantage

If circumstances or positive tags grant an advantage, add a **Chance Die** to the roll. Otherwise, when hindrances or negative tag cause a disadvantage, add a **Risk Die**. In both cases keep only the higher die of the added type when you check the roll.

Consider tags **intuitively and not quantitatively**, using the context of the situation at play. It is important to keep the flow of play fast and not accounting for advantages and disadvantages numerically!

### Twist Counter

The Twist Counter is a measure of the rising tension in the narrative. At the beginning is set to 0. Every time a double throw (dice are equal) happens, add 1 to the Counter. If the Counter is below three, consider the answer as "**Yes, but...**". Otherwise a **Twist** happens and resets the Counter.

Roll 2d6 and consult the following Twist Table to determine what kind of twist happens. 

| D6 |      Subject       |        Action       |
|:--:|:------------------:|:-------------------:|
|  1 |    A third party   |       Appears       |
|  2 |      The hero      | Alters the location |
|  3 |    An encounter    |    Helps the hero   |
|  4 |  A physical event  |   Hinders the hero  |
|  5 | An emotional event |   Changes the goal  |
|  6 |      An object     |    Ends the scene   |

Interpret the two-word sentence in the context of the current scene. Twists will keep the plot and events going in unexpected ways.

### Pulp Hero Mechanics

These specialized mechanics capture the unique aspects of pulp heroism that standard Loner rules don't address. They integrate with the Oracle system and expand your character's capabilities in thematically appropriate ways.

#### Secret Identity

Your hero lives two lives: the public face and the shadow that hunts in darkness. This duality is both your greatest strength and most dangerous weakness.

**Identity States:**
- **Civilian Identity**: Your public persona - businessman, reporter, socialite, etc.
- **Hero Identity**: Your masked vigilante persona - The Shadow, Night Hunter, etc.

**Switching Identities:**
- Takes one full scene to complete the transformation
- Requires a secure location (hideout, private office, abandoned warehouse, etc.)
- If forced to switch in public or under pressure, ask the Oracle: "Do I maintain my secret?" with disadvantage

**Mechanical Effects:**

*While in Civilian Identity:*
- **Advantage** on social interactions, information gathering, accessing restricted areas through legitimate means
- **Disadvantage** on intimidation, combat, and obviously heroic actions
- Cannot use signature weapons or equipment without risking exposure
- Gain the "Vulnerable" condition if your civilian identity is threatened

*While in Hero Identity:*
- **Advantage** on intimidation, investigation, and combat
- **Disadvantage** on social interactions requiring trust or authority
- Can use all gear and abilities freely
- Automatically inspire fear in common criminals

**Identity Exposure:**
If your secret identity is discovered or compromised:
- Gain "Exposed" condition - disadvantage on all Oracle questions involving secrecy or anonymity
- Gain "Hunted" condition - enemies actively seek you in both identities
- Enemies may target your civilian connections as leverage
- Must spend a full adventure establishing a new civilian identity or neutralizing the threat to remove conditions

**Example Situations:**
- *Civilian*: Walking into a police station to gather information, attending a society function, conducting business
- *Hero*: Confronting criminals, investigating crime scenes, engaging in rooftop chases

#### Terror and Intimidation

Pulp heroes weaponize fear as effectively as guns or fists. Your reputation becomes a tool that precedes you into every dark alley and criminal hideout.

**Fear Hierarchy:**
Different enemies respond to intimidation differently based on their experience and organization:

*Street Thugs & Petty Criminals:*
- Automatic **advantage** on intimidation
- May flee rather than fight when first encountered
- Often surrender after taking any damage in combat

*Corrupt Officials:*
- **Advantage** on intimidation if you have evidence of their crimes
- **Disadvantage** if they have legal protection or backup

*Organized Crime:*
- Normal rolls - they've heard of you and come prepared
- **Advantage** only if you've previously defeated their associates
- **Disadvantage** if they have specific countermeasures

*Occult Enemies & Masterminds:*
- Often immune to mundane intimidation
- May have **advantage** against you if they've studied your methods
- Require special approaches or evidence of supernatural power

**Building Reputation:**
Track your growing legend with reputation tags:
- After defeating significant enemies, gain reputation tags like "Dock District Terror" or "Mob Nightmare"
- Reputation tags grant **advantage** on intimidation in related situations
- But also alert enemies to prepare countermeasures

**Intimidation Methods:**
Roll on Oracle with appropriate advantages/disadvantages, then describe how you leverage fear:

*Physical Presence:* Looming from shadows, revealing weapons, demonstrating strength
*Psychological:* Revealing knowledge of their crimes, threatening loved ones, prophecies of doom
*Reputation:* "I am the shadow that claimed Tommy the Knife" - letting your legend do the work
*Environmental:* Using setting elements - cornering on rooftop, trapping in abandoned building

**Backfire Conditions:**
If intimidation fails dramatically (No, and...):
- Target becomes defiant rather than afraid
- May call for backup or raise alarms
- Could expose your location or methods
- Reputation may suffer if witnessed

#### The Code

Your moral code defines the line between hero and vigilante, between justice and vengeance. It grants power but demands sacrifice.

**Establishing Your Code:**
Choose 2-3 core principles that define your hero's moral boundaries:

*Common Codes:*
- "Never kill" - Always find non-lethal solutions
- "Protect the innocent" - Civilians come before personal goals
- "Truth above all" - Never lie, always expose corruption
- "No guns" - Rely on fists, martial arts, and non-firearm weapons
- "The law matters" - Work within legal boundaries when possible
- "No collateral damage" - Precise strikes only, minimize property destruction
- "Trust earned" - Never break a promise or betray an ally
- "Justice for all" - Rich and poor deserve equal protection

**Following Your Code:**
When acting in accordance with your code:
- Gain **advantage** on related Oracle questions
- Automatically succeed on certain actions that align with core principles
- NPCs with similar moral standards are more likely to trust and aid you
- Remove negative conditions related to guilt or moral compromise when making significant sacrifices to uphold the code

**Breaking Your Code:**
When you violate your moral principles:
- Gain "Guilt" condition (disadvantage on all social interactions and moral judgment calls)
- Cannot gain code-related advantages until amends are made
- May gain additional negative conditions based on the severity of the violation

**Making Amends:**
To remove "Guilt" and restore code benefits, you must:
- Confess the violation (to confidant, diary, or religious figure)
- Perform a redemptive act related to the violation
- Accept consequences of your actions
- Ask Oracle: "Have I truly made amends?" Success removes the condition

**Code Conflicts:**
When your principles conflict with pragmatic solutions:
- Ask Oracle: "Can I find an alternative that honors my code?"
- If "No" - must choose between effectiveness and morality
- Breaking code in service of greater principle may reduce penalty
- Repeated conflicts may force you to redefine your code

**Example Codes in Play:**
- *"Never kill" during rooftop fight*: Must find non-lethal takedown (advantage on creative solutions)
- *"Protect innocents" when criminals take hostages*: Automatically prioritize hostage safety over capturing villain
- *Breaking "no guns" to save child*: Lose 1 Luck, gain "Guilt," but gain advantage on rescue attempt

#### Investigation Chains

Pulp mysteries unfold through carefully connected clues that build toward dramatic revelations. This system helps you track and develop investigative storylines.

**Creating Leads:**
When you successfully investigate (Oracle answers "Yes" or "Yes, and..."):
- Gain a **Lead** tag describing what you discovered
- Example leads: "Warehouse Meeting Tonight," "Judge Morrison's Gambling Debts," "Ancient Symbol Connection"

**Lead Categories:**
*Physical Evidence:* Fingerprints, weapons, documents, photographs
*Witness Information:* Testimonies, overheard conversations, behavioral observations
*Location Intelligence:* Meeting places, hideouts, crime scenes, suspicious buildings
*Connection Patterns:* Financial links, shared associates, timing correlations
*Motive Insights:* Personal grudges, political aims, occult purposes

**Building the Chain:**
- Connect related leads with arrows or lines on paper
- When you have 3+ connected leads about the same subject, gain **advantage** on major revelation attempts
- Each lead can connect to multiple others, creating a web of information

**Using Lead Chains:**
*Minor Revelation (2-3 connected leads):*
- Identify immediate threat or next target
- Understand criminal method or pattern
- Locate important person or place

*Major Revelation (4+ connected leads):*
- Expose the mastermind's identity
- Understand the complete criminal conspiracy
- Predict where the climactic confrontation will occur

**False Leads:**
When investigation fails (Oracle says "No"):
- May gain a **False Lead** tag
- False leads grant **disadvantage** when pursuing related investigations
- Can be corrected by later successful investigation or by discovering contradictory evidence

**Investigation Techniques:**
Different approaches yield different types of leads:

*Crime Scene Analysis:* Physical evidence, victim connections, method signatures
*Witness Interviews:* Personal information, overheard conversations, suspicious behavior
*Records Research:* Financial trails, legal documents, historical patterns
*Surveillance:* Movement patterns, meeting locations, associate identification
*Undercover Work:* Internal information, criminal plans, organization structure

**Breakthrough Moments:**
When you have enough leads to attempt a major revelation:
- Ask Oracle: "Do I understand the true scope of this conspiracy?"
- **Advantage** if you have 4+ connected leads
- **Disadvantage** if you have false leads in the chain
- Success reveals key information and advances the plot significantly

**Example Investigation Chain:**
1. *Crime scene*: "Victim had expensive watch" (Lead: Luxury Lifestyle)
2. *Financial records*: "Judge's salary couldn't afford watch" (Lead: Hidden Income Source)
3. *Witness interview*: "Saw judge at illegal casino" (Lead: Gambling Connection)
4. *Surveillance*: "Casino owned by Torrino family" (Lead: Mob Ties)
5. *Major revelation attempt with advantage*: "Judge Morrison is fixing cases to pay gambling debts to the Torrino crime family"

#### Resources and Equipment

Pulp heroes rely on more than just fists and determination. Managing your resources adds strategic depth to your adventures.

**Resource Categories:**

*Cash Reserves:*
- Track as condition: "Well-Funded," "Comfortable," "Struggling," "Broke"
- Affects ability to purchase equipment, bribe informants, maintain hideouts
- Wealthy civilian identities provide steady income

*Hideouts and Safe Houses:*
- Primary hideout: Fully equipped base of operations
- Secondary hideouts: Emergency locations with basic supplies
- Can be discovered and compromised by enemies
- Each hideout has specific capabilities (laboratory, armory, surveillance center)

*Signature Equipment:*
Beyond the standard gear list, pulp heroes often have unique items:
- **Experimental weapons** created by allied scientists
- **Advanced vehicles** modified for pursuit and escape
- **Communication devices** for coordinating with allies
- **Forensic equipment** for crime scene analysis

**Resource Management:**
Resources can be gained, lost, or temporarily unavailable:

*Gaining Resources:*
- Successfully completing adventures
- Cultivating relationships with wealthy allies
- Discovering hidden assets during investigations
- Rewards from grateful citizens or organizations

*Losing Resources:*

**Emergency Protocols:**
When your primary resources are compromised:

- Use emergency caches of supplies and money
- Temporary disadvantage until resources are restored

#### Vehicles and Chases

High-speed pursuits through city streets are a pulp hero staple. These rules add excitement and tactical options to your adventures.

**Vehicle Types:**
*Automobiles:* Fast and maneuverable, good for urban chases
*Motorcycles:* Excellent acceleration, can navigate narrow spaces
*Aircraft:* Autogyros, small planes for aerial surveillance and pursuit
*Boats:* Harbor and river operations, smuggler interception
*Public Transport:* Streetcars, buses, subways for blending in

**Chase Mechanics:**
Chases are extended conflicts using the Oracle system:

1. **Establish the Scene:** What's the terrain? Weather conditions? Traffic density?
2. **Define Objectives:** Are you pursuing, escaping, or racing to a destination?
3. **Ask Oracle Questions:** "Do I gain ground on the target?" "Do I avoid the roadblock?"
4. **Apply Vehicle Advantages/Disadvantages:** Consider speed, maneuverability, condition

**Chase Complications:**
When Oracle results include "but..." or "and..." complications:
- *Traffic obstacles*: Pedestrians, other vehicles, construction
- *Environmental hazards*: Wet streets, fog, narrow bridges
- *Mechanical problems*: Tire blowouts, engine trouble, fuel shortage
- *Law enforcement*: Police joining the pursuit
- *Terrain changes*: Moving from streets to docks to rooftops

**Dramatic Maneuvers:**
Pulp heroes attempt impossible stunts during chases:
- **Leaping between vehicles** while in motion
- **Using the environment** - ramps, shortcuts, creative routes
- **Disabling pursuit vehicles** without killing the occupants
- **Impossible escapes** through seemingly blocked passages

**Vehicle Combat:**
When weapons are used during chases:
- Firing while driving: **Disadvantage** on attack rolls
- Ramming and sideswiping: Damage to both vehicles
- Targeting specific parts: Tires, engine, driver
- Environmental weapons: Leading enemies into obstacles

#### Dramatic Escapes

Pulp heroes routinely escape from certain death through cleverness, preparation, and dramatic timing.

**Death Trap Situations:**
Classic pulp scenarios where heroes face seemingly impossible odds:
- Tied up in a room filling with water/gas/fire
- Strapped to elaborate execution devices
- Buried alive or trapped in collapsing buildings
- Suspended over acid pits or dangerous machinery
- Locked in with deadly animals or unstable explosives

**Escape Mechanics:**
1. **Assess the Situation:** What resources do you have? What's the time limit?
2. **Look for Weaknesses:** Ask Oracle: "Is there a flaw in this trap?"
3. **Use Available Tools:** Hidden lockpicks, concealed weapons, environmental elements
4. **Make Your Attempt:** Oracle question with advantages/disadvantages based on preparation

**Preparation Bonuses:**
Heroes who think ahead gain advantages:
- **Hidden Tools:** Lockpicks in shoe heels, razor blades in coat seams
- **Emergency Plans:** Pre-arranged signals, backup allies
- **Environmental Knowledge:** Understanding building layouts, structural weaknesses
- **Psychological Insight:** Predicting villain behavior patterns

**Last-Second Timing:**
Dramatic escapes often depend on perfect timing:
- **Cavalry Arrives:** Allied forces appear at the crucial moment
- **Environmental Changes:** Train schedules, tide changes, scheduled explosions
- **Villain Mistakes:** Monologuing too long, mechanical failures
- **Chain Reactions:** One escape triggers multiple advantages

**Failed Escape Attempts:**
When escape attempts fail:
- **Partial Success:** Escape immediate death but remain trapped
- **Temporary Setback:** Must try a different approach
- **Increased Danger:** Trap becomes more complex or time runs shorter
- **Captured Again:** Face interrogation or transportation to new location

**Signature Escape Methods:**
Develop recurring themes for your hero's escapes:
- **The Technician:** Uses mechanical knowledge to disable traps
- **The Acrobat:** Physically impressive feats of agility and strength
- **The Psychologist:** Manipulates captors into making mistakes
- **The Prepared:** Always has the right tool for the situation

### Conflicts

A *Conflict* is any situation in which opponents clash, attacking, defending, or wearing each other down in order to win.
This applies both in a practical and metaphorical sense. 

So, a Conflict is not only limited to combat (or fighting) in the strict sense but also to competitive situations (such as contests, duels, verbal confrontations, etc.) in which two or more characters (including vehicles, of course!) compete.

Conflicts can be resolved in different ways depending on preferences and context:
1. Ask a single closed question. The Oracle's answer determines the outcome of the conflict.
2. Ask a series of closed questions to resolve current single actions.
3. Use the rules of Harm & Luck below.

Note that the Twist Counter **does not apply** to Harm & Luck. Instead, it is used regularly if the Conflict is handled with closed questions.

If the conflict is resolved by applying damage to the Luck trait, roll the dice to determine whether the protagonist causes damage to the opponent or suffers damage due to counterattack or failed defense. The rolls are player facing only.

The damage reduces the Luck of the target, whether protagonist or NPC. When the Luck runs out, the character has lost the conflict.

The final outcome depends on the context. Do you get caught? Are you seriously injured? You may even die if that fits the narrative.

| Answer      | Do you get what you want?                               | Harm    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Yes, and... | You get what you want, and something else.              | Cause 3 |
| Yes...      | You get what you want.                                  | Cause 2 |
| Yes, but... | You get what you want, but at a cost.                   | Cause 1 |
| No, but...  | You don't get what you want, but it's not a total loss. | Take 1  |
| No...       | You don't get what you were after.                      | Take 2  |
| No, and...  | You don't get what you want, and things get worse.      | Take 3  |

### Determine the mood of the next scene

At the end of the current scene sometimes you will be clear about the direction to take, other times you may need to determine the general mood of the next one. In this case roll 1d6 and consult the following table:

|  D6 |   Next Scene   |
|:---:|:--------------:|
| 1-3 | Dramatic scene |
| 4-5 |   Quiet Scene  |
|  6  |   Meanwhile…   |

- A **dramatic scene** does not break the tension of the previous scene but carries it further forward, introducing further obstacles or difficulties.
- During a **quiet scene** there is time to take a breath, to heal, to make plans for the next steps and to deepen relationships.
- A **meanwhile scene** takes place somewhere else, other than where the hero is. It cuts to villains or other plot-important characters.

### Open-Ended Question or Get Inspired

To answer an Open-Ended question, roll 1d6 once on each of the Inspiration Tables (roll at least a verb and a noun, adjectives are optional).

### When the story ends

At the end of the adventure you may add another trait to the character. It is better that this is related to how the story just ended and can be either a Skill, Gear, a new Frailty, or even a new Nemesis! You can also modify an existing trait to better represent an enhanced expertise.

Also update the list of **NPCs**, **Locations**, and **Events** that may show up again in future adventures.
