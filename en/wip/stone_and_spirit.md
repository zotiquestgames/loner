# Stone & Spirit

***Stone & Spirit*** is a solo tabletop RPG adventure set in the dark forests and windswept tundra of the Stone Age, where shamans walk between worlds and spirits demand blood.

This minimalist Solo Role Playing Game is designed to explore the tension between survival and spiritual power in a world where every choice carries the weight of ancient taboos.

## Introduction

*Stone & Spirit* follows the following design principles:

1. **Portable**: to play you will need a few common (six-sided) dice and writing materials. Anything else is optional and not essential.
2. **Rules-Light**: the game relies on a few rules and only one solving mechanic, easy to learn and eventually to memorize.
3. **Tag-based**: characters and situations are defined only by qualitative descriptors and no quantitative characteristics.

With a focus on quick resolutions, **Stone & Spirit** throws you headfirst into the heart of shamanic conflict. Your character will be defined by thematic tags, such as *Blood-touched*, *Spirit-scarred*, or *Ancestor-blessed*.

### What is a Role Playing Game (RPG)?
A role-playing game (RPG) is a type of game in which players assume the roles of fictional characters and act out their actions and decisions within a narrative or imaginary setting. The outcome of these actions and decisions is often determined by a set of rules and game mechanics, such as dice rolls or statistical attributes of the characters. Players may also collaborate to create a shared story or narrative through their characters' actions and interactions.

### What is a Solo RPG?

In a solo RPG a single player takes on the roles of one or more characters, while also simultaneously managing some elements of the game world. These games typically involve the use of a rule system and game mechanics to determine the outcome of actions taken by the player-controlled characters. 
Unlike a gamebook (such as the Fighting Fantasy, Lone Wolf, and Tunnels & Trolls series) a solo RPG is not a form of interactive, forked narrative in which outcomes are pre-determined and limited by the author's choices.

Through the interaction of player, oracle, tools, and prompts, the character's actions will build an **emergent narrative** within whose boundaries anything can be attempted, without predetermined limits.

### Safety Tools
You will play alone, but be sure to play in an environment that is comfortable for you, without overexerting yourself, and reserve the option to stop as soon as you feel uncomfortable for any reason, physical or emotional. Don't be afraid to tackle new themes, but do so in full awareness of your boundaries.

### Minimum Requirements
To play *Stone & Spirit* you will need:
- **4 six sided dice** (also known as d6s): two pairs of different colors
- **Paper and writing tools**: at least a sheet of scrap paper and and pencil, but index cards or sticky notes are a fine addition
- **Character sheet**: you may use the provided sheet at the back or a simple index card.
- **Notebook**: *Stone & Spirit* is not a solo journaling game, you can easily play it in the "theater of mind". But you can keep track of you game if you feel the need!

## The Three Realms

The world of Stone & Spirit is divided into three interconnected realms, each populated by different types of spirits and governed by ancient laws.

### The Upper World
- **Sky Spirits**: Thunder beings, wind walkers, star watchers
- **Weather Powers**: Storm bringers, rain dancers, sun guardians

- **Plant Spirits**: Forest guardians, herb mothers, poison keepers
- **Ancestor Spirits**: Recently dead who haven't yet moved on
- **Land Spirits**: River spirits, mountain guardians, forest watchers

### The Lower World
- **Earth Spirits**: Cave dwellers, stone guardians, underground rivers
- **Death Spirits**: Guides to the afterlife, bone collectors, grave watchers
- **Primordial Entities**: Ancient beings from before the world's shaping
- **Dark Powers**: Entities that feed on corruption and suffering

### Playable Themes

- **Shamanic Corruption**: The slow transformation from healer to monster

## Characters

In the shadow-haunted world of Stone & Spirit, you are one of the spirit-touched—those who can see beyond the veil but risk losing their humanity in the process.

### Everything is a Character!

In *Stone & Spirit* Non-Playing Characters (NPCs), Foes, Organizations, Monsters, and even relevant objects like sacred items or cursed totems are characters too!

Your Protagonist is described by some fixed traits:

- **Name**: The name should evoke the primal world and spiritual nature of the setting.
- **Concept**: A concise description of the character's role, background, and spiritual connection. The best are adjective-noun pairings, like *"Bone-reading Seer"* or *"Corrupted Healer"*.
- **Skills** (x2): Abilities not necessarily character-specific but not characteristics common to all. *"Wise"* is not a skill, *"Death-speaker"* is.
- **Frailty**: Something that could potentially get in the way of the character, either physically, mentally, or socially.
- **Gear** (x2): Particular equipment supplied to the character in coherence with the setting. Everyday items are taken for granted and do not fall under this trait.
- **Goal**: The long-term objective.
- **Motive**: What drives the pursuit of the goal.
- **Nemesis**: A person or organization that hinders the protagonist. It can emerge during the first game sessions, it may or may or not be the direct antagonist of the story, ready to appear to make life even more difficult
- **Luck**: The measure of a character's ability to avoid ill fortune or an inauspicious outcome. It applies only in Conflicts and automatically recharges when they end. Luck starts and caps at 6.

These **traits** are described by **tags**, descriptive words or phrases that can identify anything in the game world. Even the **details** of the environment in which the action moves and **conditions** (physical or mental) of the characters are tags. 

**They are qualitative representations. They are not quantitative measures.**

## Rules

*Stone & Spirit* is a minimalist Solo Role Playing Game designed to be played with only one character (the Protagonist). You'll guide them through the story that will unravel during the game, asking closed questions to an Oracle which will help you overturn your expectations.

Every now and then you will be surprised with an unexpected twist!

### Keep The Action In Motion

A game in *Stone & Spirit* is a succession of scenes. 
A scene is a unit of time in which a certain action takes place in pursuit of a certain short-term goal. 

In *Stone & Spirit* at each scene:
1. **Identify what you expect from the scene**. Compared to traits, goal, and motivation determine the Protagonist's action. What might be the reaction of the game world?
2. **Test your expectations**. When you are uncertain (or overconfident) about the reaction to your actions, [ask the Oracle](#consulting-the-oracle) a closed question (answer is Yes or No), considering the tags involved to determine if there is an [Advantage or Disadvantage](#advantage-and-disadvantage).
3. **Interpret the result**. Is the Oracle's answer in line with your expectations? If not, in the context in which the scene takes place, how should an answer that subverts them be considered?

This sequence will come to you naturally after some practice. Use it as a guideline the first few times.

### Consulting the Oracle

When you need to test your expectations you'll ask the Oracle a closed question.

You'll need 2d6 in one color (**Chance Dice**), and 2d6 in another (**Risk Dice**).

To resolve a closed question, roll one **Chance Die** and one **Risk Die**:
- If the Chance Die is highest, the answer is **Yes**. 
- If the Risk Die is highest, the answer is **No**.
- If both are low (3 or less), add a **but...**. 
- If both are high (4 or more), add an **and...**.
- If both are equal, the answer is **Yes, but...**. Add a point to the **[Twist Counter](#twist-counter)**.

| Dice Value |    Chance Die > Risk Die   | Risk Die > Chance Die |
|:----------:|:--------------------------:|:---------------------:|
|  Both < 4  |         Yes, but...        |       No, but...      |
|  Both > 3  |         Yes, and...        |       No, and...      |
| Mismatched |             Yes            |           No          |
|            |                            |                       |
|    Equal   | Add 1 to the Twist Counter |                       |

### Advantage and Disadvantage

If circumstances or positive tags grant an advantage, add a **Chance Die** to the roll. Otherwise, when hindrances or negative tag cause a disadvantage, add a **Risk Die**. In both cases keep only the higher die of the added type when you check the roll.

Consider tags **intuitively and not quantitatively**, using the context of the situation at play. It is important to keep the flow of play fast and not accounting for advantages and disadvantages numerically!

### Twist Counter

The Twist Counter is a measure of the rising tension in the narrative. At the beginning is set to 0. Every time a double throw (dice are equal) happens, add 1 to the Counter. If the Counter is below three, consider the answer as "**Yes, but...**". Otherwise a **Twist** happens and resets the Counter.

Roll 2d6 and consult the following Twist Table to determine what kind of twist happens. 

| D6 |      Subject       |        Action       |
|:--:|:------------------:|:-------------------:|
|  1 |    A third party   |       Appears       |
|  2 |      The hero      | Alters the location |
|  3 |    An encounter    |    Helps the hero   |
|  4 |  A physical event  |   Hinders the hero  |
|  5 | An emotional event |   Changes the goal  |
|  6 |      An object     |    Ends the scene   |

Interpret the two-word sentence in the context of the current scene. Twists will keep the plot and events going in unexpected ways.

### Spirit Corruption

The use of shamanic power comes with a terrible price. Each time you use supernatural abilities or commune with dark spirits, you risk spiritual corruption.

When you:
- Perform blood magic or sacrifice
- Break tribal taboos for power
- Make pacts with malevolent spirits
- Use death magic or necromancy
- Consume another's life force

Ask the Oracle: "Do I avoid corruption?" with Disadvantage. If the answer is No, gain a Corruption tag such as *Spirit-touched*, *Blood-hungry*, or *Death-marked*. These tags can provide advantages when dealing with dark powers but disadvantages in normal social situations.

When you accumulate three Corruption tags, something fundamental changes about your character. Roll on the Corruption table to see how you've been transformed.

### Spiritual Realms

Your character can attempt to enter the spirit realm through meditation, dreams, or ritual. This requires asking the Oracle with your spiritual skills providing advantage.

**Success**: You enter the chosen realm and can interact with spirits, but you're vulnerable to spiritual attacks and may become lost.

**Failure**: You remain in the physical world but may attract unwanted spiritual attention or suffer mental strain.

While in the spirit realm, physical laws don't apply, but spiritual laws are absolute. Breaking taboos or showing disrespect can have severe consequences.

### Conflicts

A *Conflict* is any situation in which opponents clash, attacking, defending, or wearing each other down in order to win.
This applies both in a practical and metaphorical sense. 

So, a Conflict is not only limited to combat (or fighting) in the strict sense but also to competitive situations (such as contests, duels, verbal confrontations, etc.) in which two or more characters (including vehicles, of course!) compete.

Conflicts can be resolved in different ways depending on preferences and context:
1. Ask a single closed question. The Oracle's answer determines the outcome of the conflict.
2. Ask a series of closed questions to resolve current single actions.
3. Use the rules of Harm & Luck below.

Note that the Twist Counter **does not apply** to Harm & Luck. Instead, it is used regularly if the Conflict is handled with closed questions.

If the conflict is resolved by applying damage to the Luck trait, roll the dice to determine whether the protagonist causes damage to the opponent or suffers damage due to counterattack or failed defense. The rolls are player facing only.

The damage reduces the Luck of the target, whether protagonist or NPC. When the Luck runs out, the character has lost the conflict.

The final outcome depends on the context. Do you get caught? Are you seriously injured? You may even die if that fits the narrative.

| Answer      | Do you get what you want?                               | Harm    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Yes, and... | You get what you want, and something else.              | Cause 3 |
| Yes...      | You get what you want.                                  | Cause 2 |
| Yes, but... | You get what you want, but at a cost.                   | Cause 1 |
| No, but...  | You don't get what you want, but it's not a total loss. | Take 1  |
| No...       | You don't get what you were after.                      | Take 2  |
| No, and...  | You don't get what you want, and things get worse.      | Take 3  |

### Determine the mood of the next scene

At the end of the current scene sometimes you will be clear about the direction to take, other times you may need to determine the general mood of the next one. In this case roll 1d6 and consult the following table:

|  D6 |   Next Scene   |
|:---:|:--------------:|
| 1-3 | Dramatic scene |
| 4-5 |   Quiet Scene  |
|  6  |   Meanwhile…   |

- A **dramatic scene** does not break the tension of the previous scene but carries it further forward, introducing further obstacles or difficulties.
- During a **quiet scene** there is time to take a breath, to heal, to make plans for the next steps and to deepen relationships.
- A **meanwhile scene** takes place somewhere else, other than where the hero is. It cuts to villains or other plot-important characters.

### Open-Ended Question or Get Inspired

To answer an Open-Ended question, roll 1d6 once on each of the Inspiration Tables (roll at least a verb and a noun, adjectives are optional).

### When the story ends

At the end of the adventure you may add another trait to the character. It is better that this is related to how the story just ended and can be either a Skill, Gear, a new Frailty, or even a new Nemesis! You can also modify an existing trait to better represent an enhanced expertise.

Also update the list of **NPCs**, **Locations**, and **Events** that may show up again in future adventures.

## Exploring the Wilderness

Stone & Spirit places great emphasis on the harsh realities of Stone Age survival combined with supernatural dangers lurking in every shadow.

### Preparation

* **Define Your Destination:** Choose a specific location on your mental map or have the Oracle determine a general direction and a rumor about spiritual activity.
* **Choose Your Mode of Travel:** Consider the season, weather, and your character's survival skills.
* **Gather Supplies:** Stock up on food, tools, and protective charms based on your journey length and known dangers.

### The Journey

#### A. Overland Exploration

* **Navigation Check:** Roll to navigate successfully. On failure, consult the "Wilderness Encounters" table for complications.
* **Weather Check:** Every day roll a d6. On 1-2, encounter harsh weather that may require shelter or cause exposure.
* **Spiritual Activity:** In areas of high spiritual activity, roll for encounters with spirits, both helpful and malevolent.

#### Reaching Your Destination

Upon reaching your destination, consult the Oracle for details about spiritual activity, tribal presence, and potential dangers. The wilderness of Stone & Spirit is never truly empty—spirits watch from every tree, and ancient taboos protect (or curse) sacred places.

## Territory Generation

Use these procedures to generate the mysterious and dangerous wilderness where your adventures unfold.

### Hex Generation (d6 method)
1. Roll 2d6 for terrain type
2. Roll 1d6 for spiritual activity level
3. Roll 1d6 for dangers present
4. Roll 1d6 for resources available

### Point Crawl Method
Create a network of significant locations connected by dangerous paths. Each location should have:
- A physical description
- Spiritual significance
- Tribal connections
- Hidden dangers
- Potential allies or enemies

## Setting Information

### Geography

The world of Stone & Spirit encompasses vast forests of pine and birch, windswept tundra, frozen rivers, and ancient caves decorated with the handprints of the ancestors. Seasons bring dramatic changes—the brief summer's abundance gives way to autumn's preparation, winter's harsh survival, and spring's spiritual awakening.

### Cultures & People

Humans live in small bands that occasionally gather into larger tribes for seasonal ceremonies, trade, or warfare. Each group maintains complex relationships with local spirits and follows elaborate taboos designed to maintain cosmic balance. Shamans serve as intermediaries between the physical and spiritual worlds, but power corrupts, and many fall to dark temptations.

### Trade and Commerce

Trade focuses on essential survival goods: obsidian for blades, amber for spiritual protection, salt for preservation, and rare herbs for healing. Spiritual services—blessings, curses, divination—form another layer of exchange, often more valuable than physical goods.

### Art and Culture

Cave paintings record both historical events and spiritual visions. Bone carvings serve as both artistic expression and magical focuses. Song and dance aren't mere entertainment but methods of communicating with spirits and preserving vital cultural knowledge.

### Magic and Mysticism

The supernatural permeates daily life. Spirits inhabit every natural feature, and shamans can communicate with them through ritual, sacrifice, and altered states of consciousness. However, this power comes with terrible risks—madness, corruption, and spiritual possession await those who delve too deeply into forbidden knowledge.

### Folklore and Mythology

Stories tell of the first shamans who walked between worlds, of spirits that devour souls, and of taboos that must never be broken lest cosmic chaos result. These aren't mere tales but practical guides for survival in a world where the supernatural is as real and dangerous as any predator.
