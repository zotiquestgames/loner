# Loner: Ragnarök

***Loner: Ragnarök*** is a solo tabletop RPG adventure set in the twilight of the gods, where the Nine Realms tremble before the approaching end of all things and heroes must choose between fighting fate or embracing their wyrd.

This minimalist Solo Role Playing Game is designed to capture the epic scope and tragic grandeur of Norse mythology, where every choice echoes through the halls of Valhalla and the roots of Yggdrasil.

## Introduction

*Loner: Ragnarök* follows the following design principles:

1. **Portable**: to play you will need a few common (six-sided) dice and writing materials. Anything else is optional and not essential.
2. **Rules-Light**: the game relies on a few rules and only one solving mechanic, easy to learn and eventually to memorize.
3. **Tag-based**: characters and situations are defined only by qualitative descriptors and no quantitative characteristics.

With a focus on quick resolutions, **Loner: Ragnarök** throws you headfirst into the heart of the action. Your character will be defined by thematic tags, such as "Battle-Scarred Einherjar," "Fate-Reading Völva," and "Oath-Bound Wanderer."

### What is a Role Playing Game (RPG)?
A role-playing game (RPG) is a type of game in which players assume the roles of fictional characters and act out their actions and decisions within a narrative or imaginary setting. The outcome of these actions and decisions is often determined by a set of rules and game mechanics, such as dice rolls or statistical attributes of the characters. Players may also collaborate to create a shared story or narrative through their characters' actions and interactions.

### What is a Solo RPG?

In a solo RPG a single player takes on the roles of one or more characters, while also simultaneously managing some elements of the game world. These games typically involve the use of a rule system and game mechanics to determine the outcome of actions taken by the player-controlled characters. 
Unlike a gamebook (such as the Fighting Fantasy, Lone Wolf, and Tunnels & Trolls series) a solo RPG is not a form of interactive, forked narrative in which outcomes are pre-determined and limited by the author's choices.

Through the interaction of player, oracle, tools, and prompts, the character's actions will build an **emergent narrative** within whose boundaries anything can be attempted, without predetermined limits.

### Safety Tools
You will play alone, but be sure to play in an environment that is comfortable for you, without overexerting yourself, and reserve the option to stop as soon as you feel uncomfortable for any reason, physical or emotional. Don't be afraid to tackle new themes, but do so in full awareness of your boundaries.

### Minimum Requirements
To play *Loner: Ragnarök* you will need:
- **4 six sided dice** (also known as d6s): two pairs of different colors
- **Paper and writing tools**: at least a sheet of scrap paper and and pencil, but index cards or sticky notes are a fine addition
- **Character sheet**: you may use the provided sheet at the back or a simple index card.
- **Notebook**: *Loner: Ragnarök* is not a solo journaling game, you can easily play it in the "theater of mind". But you can keep track of you game if you feel the need!

## The Nine Realms Tremble

The signs of the end times are manifesting across all Nine Realms. The Fimbulwinter has begun—three consecutive winters with no summer between them, bringing famine and despair to Midgard. Brothers turn against brothers, fathers against sons. The wolves Sköll and Hati grow ever closer to devouring the sun and moon. In the depths of his binding, Loki writhes, and each of his struggles shakes the foundations of reality.

Yet within this darkness, heroes emerge. Some seek to prevent Ragnarök, believing the fate of the gods can be changed. Others accept their wyrd and prepare for the glorious final battle. Still others walk between worlds, gathering knowledge and allies, weaving new threads into the tapestry of fate.

The World Tree Yggdrasil connects all realms, its roots and branches serving as pathways for those bold enough to traverse them. Each realm offers its own dangers and opportunities:

**Asgard**, realm of the Æsir, buzzes with preparation for war while political intrigue threatens to tear apart the divine host.

**Midgard**, the realm of humans, suffers under the endless winter as civilization crumbles and heroes are forged in desperation.

**Jotunheim**, land of the giants, where ancient enemies of the gods plot and scheme, knowing their time of victory approaches.

**Alfheim**, bright realm of the light elves, guards secrets of magic and wisdom that might yet change fate's course.

**Svartalfheim**, the dark realm beneath the earth, where dwarven smiths forge weapons that could slay gods or bind the unbindable.

**Vanaheim**, homeland of the Vanir gods, holds knowledge of seiðr magic and the deeper mysteries of life and death.

**Helheim**, realm of the dishonored dead, where Hel herself waits to judge all who come before her pale throne.

**Muspelheim**, the realm of fire, where Surtr sharpens his flaming sword for the final conflagration.

**Niflheim**, the primordial realm of ice and mist, where the very concept of ending was born.

### Playable Themes

In *Loner: Ragnarök*, you can explore the rich tapestry of Norse mythology through various interconnected themes:

- **Fate vs. Free Will**: The central tension between accepting wyrd and fighting to change destiny, exploring whether the gods' doom is truly inevitable.

- **Honor and Oaths**: The sacred bonds that hold society together even as the world ends, and the terrible consequences of breaking sworn words.

- **Heroic Sacrifice**: The Norse ideal of achieving glory through meaningful death, contrasted with the wisdom of survival.

- **Divine Politics**: The complex relationships between gods, giants, elves, and other powers, where alliances shift like storm clouds.

- **Forbidden Knowledge**: The pursuit of wisdom that comes at a terrible cost, following in Odin's footsteps as he sacrifices everything for understanding.

- **Legacy and Memory**: How heroes ensure their deeds will be remembered after Ragnarök, whether through skalds' songs or carved runes.

### Timeline

The game takes place during the events leading up to and including Ragnarök itself:

- **The Fimbulwinter Begins**: The first signs manifest as an endless winter grips all the realms, marking the beginning of the end times.
  
- **The Binding Weakens**: Loki's struggles against his torment grow stronger, causing earthquakes and supernatural disturbances across the Nine Realms.

- **Heroes Rise**: As civilization crumbles, extraordinary individuals emerge to shape the final chapter of this cosmic cycle.

- **The Wolf Time**: Moral order collapses as brother fights brother and the bonds of kinship dissolve in the face of despair.

- **Muster of Armies**: Both gods and giants begin gathering their forces, calling in old debts and forging new alliances for the ultimate battle.

- **The Final Battle**: Ragnarök itself, where gods and giants clash on the plains of Vigrid while Surtr's fire consumes the World Tree.

- **Rebirth**: For those who survive, a new world emerges from the ashes, where some gods return and humanity begins again.

## Characters

In *Loner: Ragnarök*, characters embody the heroic spirit of the Norse sagas, whether they serve gods or mortals, whether they embrace fate or fight against it.

### Everything is a Character!

In *Loner: Ragnarök* Non-Playing Characters (NPCs), Foes, Organizations, Monsters, and even relevant objects like ships or magical weapons are characters too!

Your Protagonist is described by some fixed traits:

- **Name**: The name should be iconic and consistent with the tone and setting of the story.
- **Concept**: A concise description of the character's role, background, and abilities. The best are adjective-name pairings, like *"Doom-Seeking Berserker"* or *"Rune-Wise Skald"*.
- **Skills** (x2): Abilities not necessarily character-specific but not characteristics common to all. *"Strong"* is not a skill, *"Giant-Slayer"* is.
- **Frailty**: Something that could potentially get in the way of the character, either physically, mentally, or socially.
- **Gear** (x2): Particular equipment supplied to the character in coherence with the setting. Everyday items are taken for granted and do not fall under this trait.
- **Goal**: The long-term objective.
- **Motive**: What drives the pursuit of the goal.
- **Nemesis**: A person or organization that hinders the protagonist. It can emerge during the first game sessions, it may or may or not be the direct antagonist of the story, ready to appear to make life even more difficult
- **Luck**: The measure of a character's ability to avoid ill fortune or an inauspicious outcome. It applies only in Conflicts and automatically recharges when they end. Luck starts and caps at 6.

These **traits** are described by **tags**, descriptive words or phrases that can identify anything in the game world. Even the **details** of the environment in which the action moves and **conditions** (physical or mental) of the characters are tags. 

**They are qualitative representations. They are not quantitative measures.**

## Rules

*Loner: Ragnarök* is a minimalist Solo Role Playing Game designed to be played with only one character (the Protagonist). You'll guide them through the story that will unravel during the game, asking closed questions to an Oracle which will help you overturn your expectations.

Every now and then you will be surprised with an unexpected twist!

### Keep The Action In Motion

A game in *Loner: Ragnarök* is a succession of scenes. 
A scene is a unit of time in which a certain action takes place in pursuit of a certain short-term goal. 

In *Loner: Ragnarök* at each scene:
1. **Identify what you expect from the scene**. Compared to traits, goal, and motivation determine the Protagonist's action. What might be the reaction of the game world?
2. **Test your expectations**. When you are uncertain (or overconfident) about the reaction to your actions, [ask the Oracle](#consulting-the-oracle) a closed question (answer is Yes or No), considering the tags involved to determine if there is an [Advantage or Disadvantage](#advantage-and-disadvantage).
3. **Interpret the result**. Is the Oracle's answer in line with your expectations? If not, in the context in which the scene takes place, how should an answer that subverts them be considered?

This sequence will come to you naturally after some practice. Use it as a guideline the first few times.

### Consulting the Oracle

When you need to test your expectations you'll ask the Oracle a closed question.

You'll need 2d6 in one color (**Chance Dice**), and 2d6 in another (**Risk Dice**).

To resolve a closed question, roll one **Chance Die** and one **Risk Die**:
- If the Chance Die is highest, the answer is **Yes**. 
- If the Risk Die is highest, the answer is **No**.
- If both are low (3 or less), add a **but...**. 
- If both are high (4 or more), add an **and...**.
- If both are equal, the answer is **Yes, but...**. Add a point to the **[Twist Counter](#twist-counter)**.

| Dice Value |    Chance Die > Risk Die   | Risk Die > Chance Die |
|:----------:|:--------------------------:|:---------------------:|
|  Both < 4  |         Yes, but...        |       No, but...      |
|  Both > 3  |         Yes, and...        |       No, and...      |
| Mismatched |             Yes            |           No          |
|            |                            |                       |
|    Equal   | Add 1 to the Twist Counter |                       |

### Advantage and Disadvantage

If circumstances or positive tags grant an advantage, add a **Chance Die** to the roll. Otherwise, when hindrances or negative tag cause a disadvantage, add a **Risk Die**. In both cases keep only the higher die of the added type when you check the roll.

Consider tags **intuitively and not quantitatively**, using the context of the situation at play. It is important to keep the flow of play fast and not accounting for advantages and disadvantages numerically!

### Twist Counter

The Twist Counter is a measure of the rising tension in the narrative. At the beginning is set to 0. Every time a double throw (dice are equal) happens, add 1 to the Counter. If the Counter is below three, consider the answer as "**Yes, but...**". Otherwise a **Twist** happens and resets the Counter.

Roll 2d6 and consult the following Twist Table to determine what kind of twist happens. 

| D6 |      Subject       |        Action       |
|:--:|:------------------:|:-------------------:|
|  1 |    A third party   |       Appears       |
|  2 |      The hero      | Alters the location |
|  3 |    An encounter    |    Helps the hero   |
|  4 |  A physical event  |   Hinders the hero  |
|  5 | An emotional event |   Changes the goal  |
|  6 |      An object     |    Ends the scene   |

Interpret the two-word sentence in the context of the current scene. Twists will keep the plot and events going in unexpected ways.

### Norse Mythology Rules

These rules are designed to be resolved using the oracular system of the game, maintaining the simplicity and fluidity of gameplay while capturing the essence of Norse mythology.

#### Wyrd and Fate

In Norse cosmology, fate (wyrd) is not predetermined but woven from the threads of past actions. However, some events are so significant that the Norns themselves have woven them into the tapestry of destiny.

- **Fate Tokens**: Start each adventure with 3 Fate Tokens. You may spend a token to:
  - Reroll any Oracle roll
  - Declare a coincidence that helps your character
  - Survive what would otherwise be certain death
- **Earning Fate Tokens**: Gain a token when you:
  - Fulfill an oath despite great personal cost
  - Choose honor over advantage
  - Perform a deed worthy of saga-telling

#### Oaths and Honor

Oaths are sacred bonds that carry supernatural weight in the Nine Realms.

- **Sworn Oaths**: When you swear an oath, gain the tag "Oath-Bound" related to that specific promise
- **Oath-Breaking**: Breaking an oath removes all Luck and adds the Frailty "Oath-Breaker"
- **Oath Fulfillment**: Completing a significant oath restores full Luck and may grant a permanent beneficial tag

#### Runic Magic

Runes hold power beyond mere writing—they can reshape reality for those who understand their secrets.

- **Carving Runes**: Spend time and appropriate materials to carve protective or empowering runes
- **Runic Activation**: When using carved runes, gain Advantage but risk destroying the rune on any "No, and..." result
- **Runic Backlash**: Failed runic magic may create the opposite effect or attract unwanted attention

#### Seiðr Sorcery

The shamanic magic of the völva involves bargaining with spirits and reading the threads of fate.

- **Seiðr Rituals**: Require time, components, and often a personal cost (memories, years of life, etc.)
- **Spirit Bargains**: When attempting seiðr magic, the Oracle may demand a price beyond the ritual requirements
- **Prophecy and Sight**: Seiðr can reveal hidden truths, but such knowledge often comes with attached obligations

### Conflicts

A *Conflict* is any situation in which opponents clash, attacking, defending, or wearing each other down in order to win.
This applies both in a practical and metaphorical sense. 

So, a Conflict is not only limited to combat (or fighting) in the strict sense but also to competitive situations (such as contests, duels, verbal confrontations, etc.) in which two or more characters (including vehicles, of course!) compete.

Conflicts can be resolved in different ways depending on preferences and context:
1. Ask a single closed question. The Oracle's answer determines the outcome of the conflict.
2. Ask a series of closed questions to resolve current single actions.
3. Use the rules of Harm & Luck below.

Note that the Twist Counter **does not apply** to Harm & Luck. Instead, it is used regularly if the Conflict is handled with closed questions.

If the conflict is resolved by applying damage to the Luck trait, roll the dice to determine whether the protagonist causes damage to the opponent or suffers damage due to counterattack or failed defense. The rolls are player facing only.

The damage reduces the Luck of the target, whether protagonist or NPC. When the Luck runs out, the character has lost the conflict.

The final outcome depends on the context. Do you get caught? Are you seriously injured? You may even die if that fits the narrative.

| Answer      | Do you get what you want?                               | Harm    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Yes, and... | You get what you want, and something else.              | Cause 3 |
| Yes...      | You get what you want.                                  | Cause 2 |
| Yes, but... | You get what you want, but at a cost.                   | Cause 1 |
| No, but...  | You don't get what you want, but it's not a total loss. | Take 1  |
| No...       | You don't get what you were after.                      | Take 2  |
| No, and...  | You don't get what you want, and things get worse.      | Take 3  |

### Determine the mood of the next scene

At the end of the current scene sometimes you will be clear about the direction to take, other times you may need to determine the general mood of the next one. In this case roll 1d6 and consult the following table:

|  D6 |   Next Scene   |
|:---:|:--------------:|
| 1-3 | Dramatic scene |
| 4-5 |   Quiet Scene  |
|  6  |   Meanwhile…   |

- A **dramatic scene** does not break the tension of the previous scene but carries it further forward, introducing further obstacles or difficulties.
- During a **quiet scene** there is time to take a breath, to heal, to make plans for the next steps and to deepen relationships.
- A **meanwhile scene** takes place somewhere else, other than where the hero is. It cuts to villains or other plot-important characters.

### Open-Ended Question or Get Inspired

To answer an Open-Ended question, roll 1d6 once on each of the Inspiration Tables (roll at least a verb and a noun, adjectives are optional).

### When the story ends

At the end of the adventure you may add another trait to the character. It is better that this is related to how the story just ended and can be either a Skill, Gear, a new Frailty, or even a new Nemesis! You can also modify an existing trait to better represent an enhanced expertise.

Also update the list of **NPCs**, **Locations**, and **Events** that may show up again in future adventures.
