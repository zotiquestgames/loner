# Wanderer Among the Stars

***Wanderer Among the Stars*** is a solo tabletop RPG adventure set in the far future where humanity has spread across countless worlds, connected by ancient ship routes and ruled by the whims of fortune and desperation.

This minimalist Solo Role Playing Game is designed to capture the essence of endless wandering through a galaxy where survival depends on wit, luck, and the constant search for passage to the next world.

## Introduction

*Wanderer Among the Stars* follows the following design principles:

1. **Portable**: to play you will need a few common (six-sided) dice and writing materials. Anything else is optional and not essential.
2. **Rules-Light**: the game relies on a few rules and only one solving mechanic, easy to learn and eventually to memorize.
3. **Tag-based**: characters and situations are defined only by qualitative descriptors and no quantitative characteristics.

With a focus on quick resolutions, **Wanderer Among the Stars** throws you headfirst into the heart of galactic wandering. Your character will be defined by thematic tags like *Knife Fighter*, *Ship Rat*, *Pleasure World Exile*, or *Earth Seeker*.

### What is a Role Playing Game (RPG)?
A role-playing game (RPG) is a type of game in which players assume the roles of fictional characters and act out their actions and decisions within a narrative or imaginary setting. The outcome of these actions and decisions is often determined by a set of rules and game mechanics, such as dice rolls or statistical attributes of the characters. Players may also collaborate to create a shared story or narrative through their characters' actions and interactions.

### What is a Solo RPG?

In a solo RPG a single player takes on the roles of one or more characters, while also simultaneously managing some elements of the game world. These games typically involve the use of a rule system and game mechanics to determine the outcome of actions taken by the player-controlled characters. 
Unlike a gamebook (such as the Fighting Fantasy, Lone Wolf, and Tunnels & Trolls series) a solo RPG is not a form of interactive, forked narrative in which outcomes are pre-determined and limited by the author's choices.

Through the interaction of player, oracle, tools, and prompts, the character's actions will build an **emergent narrative** within whose boundaries anything can be attempted, without predetermined limits.

### Safety Tools
You will play alone, but be sure to play in an environment that is comfortable for you, without overexerting yourself, and reserve the option to stop as soon as you feel uncomfortable for any reason, physical or emotional. Don't be afraid to tackle new themes, but do so in full awareness of your boundaries.

### Minimum Requirements
To play *Wanderer Among the Stars* you will need:
- **4 six sided dice** (also known as d6s): two pairs of different colors
- **Paper and writing tools**: at least a sheet of scrap paper and and pencil, but index cards or sticky notes are a fine addition
- **Character sheet**: you may use the provided sheet at the back or a simple index card.
- **Notebook**: *Wanderer Among the Stars* is not a solo journaling game, you can easily play it in the "theater of mind". But you can keep track of you game if you feel the need!

## The Galaxy of Wanderers

In the far future, humanity has spread across countless worlds throughout the galaxy, connected by an intricate web of trade routes and starship passages. The age of great empires has passed, leaving behind a patchwork of independent worlds, each struggling to maintain its place in the cosmic order.

### The Nature of Space Travel
- **Expensive and Dangerous**: Starship passage is costly, and most travelers must work their way between worlds or risk the brutal conditions of low passage
- **Ship Hierarchies**: Each vessel operates as a closed society with rigid castes - from wealthy passengers in luxury suites to desperate low-passage travelers in frozen sleep
- **Trade Routes**: Ancient patterns of commerce connect worlds, but routes can shift based on politics, economics, or stellar phenomena
- **Isolation**: Many worlds exist in relative isolation, developing unique cultures, technologies, and problems over generations

### The Great Search
- **The Lost World**: Among all the scattered worlds of humanity, one remains mythical - Earth, the legendary birthworld that may no longer exist
- **Wanderers**: Those who search from world to world, driven by hope, desperation, or an unshakeable belief that somewhere among the stars lies their true destination
- **False Leads**: Every world has stories, rumors, and supposed clues about Earth's location, most leading nowhere
- **The Journey Itself**: For many, the search becomes more important than the destination, as each world offers new challenges and opportunities

### Playable Themes

- **Survival and Resource Management**: Scraping together credits for passage, finding work, avoiding starvation
- **The Search for Earth**: Following clues, investigating legends, pursuing the impossible dream
- **Underworld Activities**: Smuggling, gambling, mercenary work, and the gray areas of galactic society
- **World-hopping Adventure**: Each planet offers unique challenges, from primitive settlements to decadent pleasure worlds
- **Identity and Belonging**: Finding one's place in a galaxy where home is always the next world over
- **Political Intrigue**: Navigation between competing factions, local governments, and galactic powers

### Timeline

The exact date is irrelevant - this is the deep future, thousands of years after humanity first reached the stars. What matters is the cycle: worlds rise and fall, trade routes shift, empires crumble, but the ships continue to sail between the stars, carrying their human cargo from world to world in an endless dance of commerce and survival.

## Characters

In the galaxy of wanderers, every person you meet has a story, a destination, and a reason for being far from home. Whether you're playing the protagonist searching for legendary Earth or any of the countless individuals who populate the shipping lanes and spaceports, each character represents someone caught in the vast web of galactic society.

### Everything is a Character!

In *Wanderer Among the Stars* Non-Playing Characters (NPCs), Foes, Organizations, Monsters, and even relevant objects like starships are characters too!

Your Protagonist is described by some fixed traits:

- **Name**: The name should be iconic and consistent with the tone and setting of the story.
- **Concept**: A concise description of the character's profession, background, and abilities. The best are adjective-name pairings, like *"Seasoned Wanderer"* or *"Exiled Noble"*.
- **Skills** (x2): Abilities not necessarily character-specific but not characteristics common to all. *"Smart"* is not a skill, *"Knife Fighter"* is.
- **Frailty**: Something that could potentially get in the way of the character, either physically, mentally, or socially.
- **Gear** (x2): Particular equipment supplied to the character in coherence with the setting. Everyday items are taken for granted and do not fall under this trait.
- **Goal**: The long-term objective.
- **Motive**: What drives the pursuit of the goal.
- **Nemesis**: A person or organization that hinders the protagonist. It can emerge during the first game sessions, it may or may or not be the direct antagonist of the story, ready to appear to make life even more difficult
- **Luck**: The measure of a character's ability to avoid ill fortune or an inauspicious outcome. It applies only in Conflicts and automatically recharges when they end. Luck starts and caps at 6.

These **traits** are described by **tags**, descriptive words or phrases that can identify anything in the game world. Even the **details** of the environment in which the action moves and **conditions** (physical or mental) of the characters are tags. 

**They are qualitative representations. They are not quantitative measures.**

## Rules

*Wanderer Among the Stars* is a minimalist Solo Role Playing Game designed to be played with only one character (the Protagonist). You'll guide them through the story that will unravel during the game, asking closed questions to an Oracle which will help you overturn your expectations.

Every now and then you will be surprised with an unexpected twist!

### Keep The Action In Motion

A game in *Wanderer Among the Stars* is a succession of scenes. 
A scene is a unit of time in which a certain action takes place in pursuit of a certain short-term goal. 

In *Wanderer Among the Stars* at each scene:
1. **Identify what you expect from the scene**. Compared to traits, goal, and motivation determine the Protagonist's action. What might be the reaction of the game world?
2. **Test your expectations**. When you are uncertain (or overconfident) about the reaction to your actions, [ask the Oracle](#consulting-the-oracle) a closed question (answer is Yes or No), considering the tags involved to determine if there is an [Advantage or Disadvantage](#advantage-and-disadvantage).
3. **Interpret the result**. Is the Oracle's answer in line with your expectations? If not, in the context in which the scene takes place, how should an answer that subverts them be considered?

This sequence will come to you naturally after some practice. Use it as a guideline the first few times.

### Consulting the Oracle

When you need to test your expectations you'll ask the Oracle a closed question.

You'll need 2d6 in one color (**Chance Dice**), and 2d6 in another (**Risk Dice**).

To resolve a closed question, roll one **Chance Die** and one **Risk Die**:
- If the Chance Die is highest, the answer is **Yes**. 
- If the Risk Die is highest, the answer is **No**.
- If both are low (3 or less), add a **but...**. 
- If both are high (4 or more), add an **and...**.
- If both are equal, the answer is **Yes, but...**. Add a point to the **[Twist Counter](#twist-counter)**.

| Dice Value |    Chance Die > Risk Die   | Risk Die > Chance Die |
|:----------:|:--------------------------:|:---------------------:|
|  Both < 4  |         Yes, but...        |       No, but...      |
|  Both > 3  |         Yes, and...        |       No, and...      |
| Mismatched |             Yes            |           No          |
|            |                            |                       |
|    Equal   | Add 1 to the Twist Counter |                       |

### Advantage and Disadvantage

If circumstances or positive tags grant an advantage, add a **Chance Die** to the roll. Otherwise, when hindrances or negative tag cause a disadvantage, add a **Risk Die**. In both cases keep only the higher die of the added type when you check the roll.

Consider tags **intuitively and not quantitatively**, using the context of the situation at play. It is important to keep the flow of play fast and not accounting for advantages and disadvantages numerically!

### Twist Counter

The Twist Counter is a measure of the rising tension in the narrative. At the beginning is set to 0. Every time a double throw (dice are equal) happens, add 1 to the Counter. If the Counter is below three, consider the answer as "**Yes, but...**". Otherwise a **Twist** happens and resets the Counter.

Roll 2d6 and consult the following Twist Table to determine what kind of twist happens. 

| D6 |      Subject       |        Action       |
|:--:|:------------------:|:-------------------:|
|  1 |    A third party   |       Appears       |
|  2 |      The hero      | Alters the location |
|  3 |    An encounter    |    Helps the hero   |
|  4 |  A physical event  |   Hinders the hero  |
|  5 | An emotional event |   Changes the goal  |
|  6 |      An object     |    Ends the scene   |

Interpret the two-word sentence in the context of the current scene. Twists will keep the plot and events going in unexpected ways.

### Credits and Commerce

Credits are the universal currency of the galaxy, but they're always in short supply for wanderers. Use the Oracle to determine:
- **Can you afford passage?** Consider your recent activities and any income sources
- **Does the trader accept your offer?** Factor in your negotiation skills and what you're offering
- **Is work available?** Based on the world's economy and your reputation
- **Can you gather the resources you need?** Depending on local availability and your connections

### Ship Passage and Travel

Getting from world to world requires passage on a starship, and passage costs credits. Different classes of travel offer different experiences:
- **High Passage**: Luxury accommodations with meals and entertainment
- **Middle Passage**: Basic but comfortable travel with standard amenities  
- **Low Passage**: Suspended animation for the journey - cheap but dangerous
- **Working Passage**: Earn your way by serving as crew

Use the Oracle to determine passage availability, cost negotiations, and journey complications.

### Temptation

Every now and then, the wandering seems to end.

You find a place that offers comfort, or a person who makes you feel known. You’re handed a truth too heavy to carry further, or offered a seat in a room where decisions are made. You win something — and then you're asked to stay.

But you’re a wanderer. Are you?

After moments of victory, survival, or relief — when a scene ends well — ask yourself:

> **What might keep me here?**

Roll or choose from the table below to define the temptation you face. You don’t need to act on it. But acknowledging it gives weight to your next decision.

| d6 | Temptation                                                              |
| -- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1  | **Love or companionship** — someone sees you and wants you to stay      |
| 2  | **Position of power** — control over people, resources, or fate         |
| 3  | **Safety and comfort** — a rare sense of peace, warmth, and rest        |
| 4  | **The promise of truth** — answers to questions you've carried too long |
| 5  | **Healing or redemption** — a chance to forgive or be forgiven          |
| 6  | **A false version of your goal** — something close, but wrong           |

You may:

* Write a **tag** for the temptation (*Offered a Ship Command*, *Safehouse with Zeva*, *Fake Earth Coordinates*)
* Let it color your next scene, decision, or departure
* Reject it outright — and carry the cost of that too

**You don’t track temptation mechanically.** You carry it. If you stay, you change the story. If you leave, you keep the story moving — but at a price only you know.

## Gear and Limits

You don’t carry everything. You carry what matters — what you can keep close, protect, or recover quickly when trouble comes.

To keep inventory grounded without overloading the fiction, use the following rule:

### Carry Limit

You can carry and manage up to **6 Gear Tags** at a time without difficulty.

These represent your core tools, possessions, and useful items — anything from weapons to relics, key documents to specialized tech.

Each Gear Tag should be:

* Distinct and evocative
* Immediately useful or significant
* Something you’d notice if lost

> *Example Gear Tags: Plasma Torch, Widow's Blade, Falsified Identity, Encoded Prayer Strip, Dried Hunger Root, Salvaged Auto-Pistol*

### Overcapacity

If you come into possession of **more than 6 Gear Tags**, you must immediately:

* **Drop** or abandon something
* **Trade** or gift it away
* Or **stash it somewhere** (note the location as a tag or world thread)

You can always write down what you left behind — but if you want to come back for it, you'll need to remember where, and what may have changed since.

### Gear Categories

To help with fiction, you can loosely sort your gear into:

* **Worn** — things you carry on your person, ready to use
* **Stowed** — packed or hidden, not immediately accessible
* **Cached** — stored off-site, in a safehouse, ship compartment, or buried somewhere

This distinction is entirely narrative. You decide what’s within reach — and what’s not — when a scene begins.

## Debts and Favors

This rule handles obligations between characters. Use it to track who owes what, and to create story consequences that matter.

### Owing a Favor

When you receive help that goes beyond normal interaction — healing, hiding, gear, clearance, forged documents, protection — write a tag:

> `Owes a Favor – [Name, Place, or Faction]`

You can carry as many as make sense. The more you owe, the more vulnerable you are.

You must pay these off fictionally. Until you do, the person or group may:

* Contact you for a job or request
* Refuse to help you again
* Send someone to collect
* Use the favor as leverage

### Paying a Favor Back

To clear the tag, you must:

* Do something **risky** for them
* **Give something up** (gear, credits, relationship)
* Shift the cost onto someone else (by betrayal or deflection)

Once paid, cross out the tag.

> *If uncertain, ask the Oracle: “Is this enough to settle the favor?”*

### Being Owed a Favor

If you go out of your way to help someone — saving them, sparing them, protecting them — you may write:

> `Is Owed a Favor – [Name or Faction]`

You may try to call this in later, but:

* They might not agree with your terms
* They may not be in a position to help
* They could turn on you instead

> *Ask the Oracle: “Will they come through for me?”*

### You Don’t Track Numbers

There’s no currency or clock here. Favors work like tags: narrative weight, not mechanics. If you forget about them, that’s on you. If you stack too many, expect complications. Keep it tight. Keep it dangerous. And don’t owe more than you can repay.

### Conflicts

A *Conflict* is any situation in which opponents clash, attacking, defending, or wearing each other down in order to win.
This applies both in a practical and metaphorical sense. 

So, a Conflict is not only limited to combat (or fighting) in the strict sense but also to competitive situations (such as contests, duels, verbal confrontations, etc.) in which two or more characters (including vehicles, of course!) compete.

Conflicts can be resolved in different ways depending on preferences and context:
1. Ask a single closed question. The Oracle's answer determines the outcome of the conflict.
2. Ask a series of closed questions to resolve current single actions.
3. Use the rules of Harm & Luck below.

Note that the Twist Counter **does not apply** to Harm & Luck. Instead, it is used regularly if the Conflict is handled with closed questions.

If the conflict is resolved by applying damage to the Luck trait, roll the dice to determine whether the protagonist causes damage to the opponent or suffers damage due to counterattack or failed defense. The rolls are player facing only.

The damage reduces the Luck of the target, whether protagonist or NPC. When the Luck runs out, the character has lost the conflict.

The final outcome depends on the context. Do you get caught? Are you seriously injured? You may even die if that fits the narrative.

| Answer      | Do you get what you want?                               | Harm    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Yes, and... | You get what you want, and something else.              | Cause 3 |
| Yes...      | You get what you want.                                  | Cause 2 |
| Yes, but... | You get what you want, but at a cost.                   | Cause 1 |
| No, but...  | You don't get what you want, but it's not a total loss. | Take 1  |
| No...       | You don't get what you were after.                      | Take 2  |
| No, and...  | You don't get what you want, and things get worse.      | Take 3  |


## Harm and Consequences

When you get hurt, it costs you something real — time, trust, tools, or the truth. This rule defines what happens **when your Luck runs out**, and the risks you're taking catch up with you.

### When to Apply Consequences

If you fail a risky or dangerous action **and your Luck is already depleted**, you must take a **Consequence**.

This is not optional. You don’t just lose — you suffer.

Roll **1d6** or choose the outcome that best fits the fiction:

| d6 | Consequence                                                                    |
| -- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1  | **Wounded** — take a tag like *Cracked Ribs*, *Burned Arm*, *Bleeding Out*     |
| 2  | **Captured or Trapped** — you’re in a cell, pinned, or restrained              |
| 3  | **Marked** — someone saw too much; you’re *Hunted*, *Flagged*, *Recognized*    |
| 4  | **Lost Something Essential** — a weapon, a piece of evidence, a friend's trust |
| 5  | **Trust Broken** — an NPC now fears you, hates you, or cuts ties               |
| 6  | **False Hope** — what you thought was a win was a setup, mistake, or lie       |

Tags from consequences are serious. They **linger** until you resolve them through fiction.

### Removing a Consequence

A tag from harm or fallout can only be cleared when:

* You **pay a price** (credits, gear, opportunity)
* You **earn help** (via a Favor or hard-won trust)
* You **take another risk** to escape or repair the damage
* You **sacrifice something else** of equal narrative weight

> You can always ask the Oracle:
> *Can I remove this tag now?*
> But be prepared to answer *how* and *what it cost*.

### Stacking Consequences

You may carry more than one tag from Consequences. If they start to weigh heavily:

* Let them change how you roleplay your character
* Let them force desperate decisions
* Let them become reasons you *must leave* the current world

### Determine the mood of the next scene

At the end of the current scene sometimes you will be clear about the direction to take, other times you may need to determine the general mood of the next one. In this case roll 1d6 and consult the following table:

|  D6 |   Next Scene   |
|:---:|:--------------:|
| 1-3 | Dramatic scene |
| 4-5 |   Quiet Scene  |
|  6  |   Meanwhile…   |

- A **dramatic scene** does not break the tension of the previous scene but carries it further forward, introducing further obstacles or difficulties.
- During a **quiet scene** there is time to take a breath, to heal, to make plans for the next steps and to deepen relationships.
- A **meanwhile scene** takes place somewhere else, other than where the hero is. It cuts to villains or other plot-important characters.

### Open-Ended Question or Get Inspired

To answer an Open-Ended question, roll 1d6 once on each of the Inspiration Tables (roll at least a verb and a noun, adjectives are optional).

### When the story ends

At the end of the adventure you may add another trait to the character. It is better that this is related to how the story just ended and can be either a Skill, Gear, a new Frailty, or even a new Nemesis! You can also modify an existing trait to better represent an enhanced expertise.

Also update the list of **NPCs**, **Locations**, and **Events** that may show up again in future adventures.

## Traveling the Galaxy

Wanderer Among the Stars captures the essence of constant movement between worlds, the search for passage, and the dangers and opportunities that come with life aboard starships and in spaceports.

### Finding Passage

* **Assess Your Resources:** Count your credits, evaluate your skills, and determine what class of passage you can afford or work toward.
* **Visit the Port:** Every world has a spaceport where ships dock and passengers book passage. Use the Oracle to determine what ships are available and their destinations.
* **Negotiate Terms:** Different captains have different policies. Some want cash up front, others might accept work, trade goods, or even information as payment.

### The Journey Between Worlds

#### Starship Travel

* **Departure Check:** Roll d6 for departure complications. On 1-2, delays occur (mechanical problems, cargo issues, passenger difficulties).
* **Journey Events:** For longer voyages, roll d6 daily. On 1, consult the "Starship Events" table for complications or opportunities.
* **Social Dynamics:** Ships are closed societies. Use the Oracle to determine your standing with crew and passengers, and how this affects your journey.
* **Arrival Complications:** Upon reaching your destination, roll d6. On 1-2, face customs issues, port strikes, or other complications that might strand you temporarily.

#### Working Passage

If you're earning your passage through work:
* **Performance Check:** Daily Oracle checks to see if you're meeting expectations
* **Relationship Building:** Develop connections with crew members that might lead to future opportunities  
* **Skills Development:** Potentially gain experience that could become new Skills or modify existing ones

### Reaching Your Destination

Upon arrival at a new world, several factors determine your immediate situation:
* **Local Conditions:** Is the world prosperous or struggling? Peaceful or dangerous?
* **Your Resources:** How much credit do you have left? What contacts might you make?
* **Opportunities:** What work, information, or leads toward your goal might be available?

Use the Oracle and random tables to determine the nature of each world, the opportunities it presents, and the challenges you'll face while there.

## **New World Arrival**

When your protagonist lands on a new world, you begin a new chapter in their journey. Every planet is different, and while you don’t need to simulate every detail of planetary geography or culture, you do need to understand what kind of place this is — and why it matters to you.

This procedure helps you quickly sketch the **flavor**, **instability**, and **immediate engagement** of the world, without prep or external reference.

### **Step 1: Define the World**

#### 1.1 World Type

Roll **D66** on the **World Types** table. This defines the world’s dominant purpose, culture, or infrastructure.

> *Example: You roll 21 → Frontier Settlement.*

#### 1.2 Cultural Trait

Roll **1d6** to determine the world’s social tone. This describes how people behave and how power is structured.

> *Example: You roll 2 → Decadent. The settlement is wealthy, disinterested, and corrupt.*


| d6 | Cultural Trait | Examples                                           |
| -- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |

| 6  | Collectivist   | Community bonds, shared work, localized governance |


#### 1.3 Immediate Trouble

Roll **1d6** to determine what’s currently going wrong — the local tension or instability.

> *Example: You roll 6 → Offworld Entanglement. A megacorporation is negotiating a “partnership” with local nobles.*


| d6 | Immediate Trouble        | Questions it raises                            |
| -- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 1  | Resource Crisis          | What’s running out? Who’s hoarding it?         |
| 2  | Faction Conflict         | Who’s fighting, and what sparked it?           |
| 3  | Infiltration or Intrigue | Who’s spying, and who do they answer to?       |
| 4  | Decay or Collapse        | What system is failing? Can it be fixed?       |
| 5  | Suppressed Uprising      | Who’s close to open revolt?                    |
| 6  | Offworld Entanglement    | Who’s interfering from orbit or another world? |


### Step 2: Landing Scene

Now that you know *what this world is*, define what it *feels like* to arrive. Roll to anchor yourself in the fiction.

#### 2.1 First Impression (1d6)

This is what strikes you first upon disembarkation. Write a tag or question based on what you see.

> *Example: "Noble guards with gold masks" or "Why are they checking every name?"*


| d6 | First Impression                                   |
| -- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 1  | Tight security — visible weapons and scanners      |
| 2  | Endless paperwork — port staff bored and slow      |
| 3  | Street-level chaos — beggars, vendors, recruits    |
| 4  | Cultural display — chanting, theater, ritual       |
| 5  | Local unrest — sirens, arguments, blackouts        |
| 6  | Unwanted attention — someone’s watching or waiting |

#### 2.2 Port Situation (1d6)

The port itself may complicate or color your arrival. This might define your **first encounter**, or a potential **scene trigger**.


| d6 | Port Situation                                       |
| -- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 1  | You're stuck inside — delays or lockdown             |
| 2  | Red flag — your ID or cargo is questioned            |
| 3  | An old contact appears — and they’re in trouble      |
| 4  | A stranger offers immediate work                     |
| 5  | Port sweep — authorities hunting someone             |
| 6  | A dangerous rumor reaches you (roll on Rumors table) |


### Step 3: Set Your Intent

Decide what you’re trying to do here. Choose one — or define your own.

* Find work
* Follow a clue
* Lay low
* Contact someone
* Explore the world
* Prepare to leave again

This **doesn’t limit your play**, but gives direction to your **first scene**.

Use this choice to:

* Frame your first **closed question**
* Identify relevant **tags**
* Decide if you’re acting under **pressure, advantage, or desperation**

### Step 4: Begin Play

With the above steps complete, you are ready to frame your first scene on this world.

You now have:

* **World identity** (Type + Culture + Trouble)
* **Initial sensory anchor** (First Impression)
* **Point of contact or obstacle** (Port Situation)
* **Your protagonist’s goal** (Intent)

From here, use the Oracle and your character’s tags to push forward.
If you don’t know what happens next — ask. If you know exactly what you want — test it.

Your wandering continues.

## Between Worlds

Between one world and the next, there's always a stretch of time — sometimes hours, sometimes weeks — suspended in vacuum. Alone in your cabin, or among strangers who don’t ask questions, you think. You remember. You prepare.

This moment between destinations is not downtime. It’s where the threads of your journey tighten.

Before beginning the New World Arrival procedure, take a brief pause to resolve the following prompts. They help carry meaning across episodes and reinforce the themes of long-term pursuit, loss, and consequence.

### **1. Pursuit of Your Goal**

If your character has a personal **Goal** (as defined during character creation), ask:

* Did something in the last world relate to your goal, directly or indirectly?
* Was there a **rumor, clue, symbol, or reference** that could now seem relevant?

You may:

* Invent a clue (something you learned, stole, or overheard)
* Roll once on the **Rumors and Leads** table, interpreting the result in light of your own journey
* Or ask the Oracle:

  > *Does what I found bring me closer to what I'm looking for?*

Update your journal or tags if the clue is substantial.

### 2. Threads Left Behind

Think back on your last visit. Not everything ends cleanly.

Ask:

* Did I leave someone behind — an ally, an enemy, or a witness?
* Did I break a deal, make a promise, or spark someone’s curiosity?
* Did anyone see me at my worst?

If so, create a **tagged thread**:

> *Owes a Favor – Zeno Port*
> *Syndicate Attention – Mira Station*
> *Made a Friend – Captain Nyra*

You don’t need to track these numerically. They exist in the fiction and return only when the story demands it.

### 3. Nemesis Update (Optional)

If a **Nemesis** was named during character creation (or emerged in play), consider:

* Did they act in the last story?
* Have they grown in influence, or are they closer?
* Are they still the same person or force?

You may:

* Add a **new trait or tag** to your Nemesis
* Replace your Nemesis with a new one, if the old has been resolved
* Ask the Oracle:

  > *Has my Nemesis caught up with me?*
  > *Have they moved their pieces while I moved mine?*

### 4. Emotional Debrief

Answer one or more of the following (silently or in writing):

* *What did I lose on that world?*
* *What did I gain?*
* *What did I walk away from?*
* *Why did I choose to keep moving?*

You may alter a **Frailty**, update your **Goal**, or note a subtle shift in your protagonist's attitude. The journey changes everyone.

## Setting Information

### Galactic Geography

The galaxy is vast and largely unknown. Humanity occupies a relatively small portion, connected by established trade routes that form the backbone of interstellar civilization. Beyond these routes lie unexplored regions, lost colonies, and perhaps the legendary Earth itself.

**Core Worlds**: Ancient, established planets with stable governments and economies. These worlds serve as major trade hubs but can be expensive and heavily regulated.

**Frontier Worlds**: Newer colonies struggling to establish themselves. Often offer opportunities for those willing to take risks, but lack amenities and can be dangerous.

**Trade Route Nexuses**: Strategic locations where multiple shipping lanes intersect. These tend to be cosmopolitan but also attract criminal elements.

**Lost Worlds**: Colonies that have fallen out of contact with the main body of humanity. Some have reverted to primitivism, others have developed in unexpected directions.

### Cultures & People

Humanity has diversified across the galaxy, with each world developing its own customs, technologies, and social structures based on local conditions and historical circumstances.

**Shipboard Culture**: Those who live permanently aboard starships, moving cargo and passengers between worlds. They form a distinct culture with their own traditions and hierarchies.

**Station Dwellers**: People who live on space stations and orbital facilities, serving as intermediaries between worlds and ship crews.

**Planetary Colonists**: The majority of humanity, living on the surface of worlds and developing local customs and technologies.

**The Dispossessed**: Refugees, exiles, and wanderers who move from world to world without permanent homes, often forming their own informal networks and communities.

### Trade and Commerce

The galactic economy depends on the exchange of goods, information, and services between worlds. Each planet tends to specialize based on its resources and conditions.

**Luxury Goods**: High-value items that can justify the cost of interstellar transport
**Raw Materials**: Worlds rich in rare elements or unique biological resources
**Information**: Knowledge, data, and cultural products that can be transmitted or carried
**Services**: Specialized skills and expertise that can't be easily replicated

Credits serve as the universal medium of exchange, but barter, work contracts, and favor-trading are also common.

### Art and Culture

Cultural exchange happens primarily through the ships that travel between worlds. Crew members and passengers carry stories, music, art, and ideas from world to world, creating a loose galactic culture while local worlds maintain their own distinct traditions.

### Technology and Engineering

Technology varies widely between worlds. Some maintain advanced industrial bases, while others have fallen into decline or focused on different technological paths.

**Starship Technology**: The most universally maintained technology, as it's essential for interstellar contact
**Medical Knowledge**: Varies greatly, with some worlds having advanced capabilities while others lack basic care
**Communication**: Instantaneous communication between star systems remains impossible, making information a valuable commodity
**Weapons and Defense**: Every world faces the challenge of protecting itself with limited resources

### Beliefs and Philosophy

Religious and philosophical movements spread along trade routes, evolving and adapting to local conditions on each world.

**The Earth Seekers**: Those who believe that finding humanity's birthworld will solve the problems of galactic civilization
**Ship Cults**: Religious movements centered around the worship of starships and stellar travel
**World Spirits**: Local planetary religions that develop unique relationships with their specific environments
**The Unity Movement**: Philosophers who seek to reunite humanity under a common government and purpose

**Trade Alliances**: Groups of worlds that cooperate for mutual economic benefit  
**Defense Pacts**: Military alliances formed to protect against common threats

| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 11  | Your vessel enters a debris field — hull damage or navigation failure imminent. |
| 12  | Unexpected solar flare — instruments glitch, and something vital burns out.     |
| 13  | You receive a distress signal from a derelict ship.                             |
| 14  | Autopilot reroutes — destination changed without your input.                    |
| 15  | Cargo leak — toxic, unstable, or illegal.                                       |
| 16  | An unseen craft shadows your trajectory.                                        |
| 21  | Someone has tampered with your nav system.                                      |
| 22  | Fuel reserves are lower than expected — you may not make it.                    |
| 23  | Mechanical failure — life support flickers or power drops.                      |
| 24  | Dreams become strange and repetitive — memory loop or psychic bleed?            |
| 25  | You’re hailed by someone using a name you haven’t used in years.                |
| 26  | You pass through a cold graveyard of ships — something is still moving.         |
| 31  | Time distortion — clocks and sensors lose sync, jump unclear.                   |
| 32  | Your ship’s AI (or assistant system) starts asking questions it shouldn’t.      |
| 33  | You detect a passenger or stowaway aboard — and you didn’t bring anyone.        |
| 34  | Internal fire — contained, but barely.                                          |
| 35  | Communications intercept — you hear fragments of conversation about you.        |
| 36  | You black out mid-jump — time lost, destination uncertain.                      |
| 41  | Automated warning: "DO NOT RETURN TO LAST PORT" — no explanation given.         |
| 42  | Security lockdown — one of your systems is sealed off.                          |
| 43  | Sudden power spike — systems reboot, and logs are wiped.                        |
| 44  | Your ship is scanned by a vessel with no registry.                              |
| 45  | Hallucinations — you’re not sure if you’re dreaming or waking.                  |
| 46  | Jump trajectory intersects a drifting installation — do you stop or steer away? |
| 51  | A message is waiting for you — sent days before you left.                       |
| 52  | The stars don’t match your charts — are you off-course?                         |
| 53  | Minor impact — something is now rattling inside the hull.                       |
| 54  | A leak — not air, but something else. Something warm.                           |
| 55  | Fuel contamination — ship performance degrades unexpectedly.                    |
| 56  | Surveillance drone attached to your hull — not yours.                           |
| 61  | You receive coordinates to a place you’ve never heard of, marked URGENT.        |
| 62  | You dream of a person who shouldn't exist — and wake with something of theirs.  |
| 63  | Something is growing inside the wall panels.                                    |
| 64  | Your last payment didn’t go through — port access might be denied.              |
| 65  | A personal item is missing — or replaced.                                       |
| 66  | A familiar song begins playing over comms — from a system long dead.            |

## Appendix: Playing *Wanderer Among Stars* with *Spacer*

This appendix expands *Wanderer Among Stars* using the optional systems, tables, and structures from *Loner: Spacer*, without replacing its narrative-first flow. Use it only if you want to dive deeper into starship design, planetary economies, star system generation, or interstellar trade.

### What *Spacer* Adds

While *Wanderer Among Stars* gives you a strong narrative loop (world-hopping, oracle-driven play, twists, consequences), *Spacer* expands the game’s scope in these areas:

* **Starship Creation**: Turn your ship into a full-fledged character with modules, condition, and frailties.
* **System & Planet Generation**: Create detailed star systems, worlds, and orbits using structured tables.
* **Economy & Trade**: Buy/sell goods, manage credits, track wealth tags and market conditions.
* **Starship Travel & Fuel**: Navigate space with procedures for fuel use, travel mishaps, docking fees, and jump risks.
* **Cargo & Smuggling**: Handle goods with tags like *fragile*, *illegal*, *valuable*, and interact with Spacer's economic mini-game.

None of these are required. They are modular bolt-ons. Choose only what enhances your story.

### How to Integrate *Spacer* Modules

#### 1. **Starship as Character**

If your wanderer owns or gains a ship, use *Spacer*'s rules to define it:

* Give it a **Name**, **Type**, **Modules** (up to 4), **Condition**, and **Frailty**
* Treat the ship like a Wanderer character: it can have scenes, suffer consequences, and evolve
* Example:
  **Void Nomad**

  * Type: Courier
  * Modules: Basic Thrusters, Smuggler’s Hold, Advanced Sensors, Shield Generator
  * Condition: Worn
  * Frailty: Incompatible Systems

Use Wanderer’s existing tags and twist mechanics when piloting the ship or facing space danger.

#### 2. **System and World Generation**

Before landing on a new world, optionally use *Spacer*’s system generation procedure:

* Roll for **Star Type**, **Planetary Orbits**, and **Special Traits**
* For the destination world, use *Spacer*’s **Civilization Level**, **Planetary Features**, and **Tags** alongside *Wanderer*’s New World Arrival
* This gives you additional inspiration before the landing scene

Use *Wanderer*’s **Landing Scene** and **Port Situation** tables as your narrative entry point.

#### 3. **Credits and Trade**

If you enjoy tracking credits:

* Use *Spacer*’s **Credit values**, **Living Costs**, **Wealth Tags**, and **Barter Rules**
* Evaluate your wealth between scenes or when securing passage
* Ask the Oracle if a purchase or sale is viable, then roll on *Spacer*’s **Market Modifier** table for price shifts

Otherwise, keep *Wanderer*’s abstract approach and use tags like *"Low on Credits"*, *"Merchant Favor Owed"*, etc.

#### 4. **Trading and Cargo Runs**

If your wanderer starts trading between worlds:

* Use *Spacer*’s **Cargo Tags**, **Condition**, and **Value Modifiers**
* Let the ship’s cargo capacity (via modules) define how much you can move
* Ask the Oracle: *“Is this a profitable route?”*, *“Is the cargo damaged?”*, etc.

Use this sparingly—*Wanderer* is not a trade simulator, but a cargo job or smuggling run can serve as a narrative frame for your next world.

#### 5. **Fuel, Maintenance & Jump Mishaps**

If you want more tension between worlds:

* Track **Fuel**, **Docking Fees**, and **Ship Maintenance** using *Spacer*
* Before hyperspace travel, ask the Oracle or roll for **FTL Mishaps** (catastrophic malfunctions, errors, delays)

This deepens the theme of resource scarcity and helps structure downtime between *Wanderer* scenes.

### Tone and Theme Compatibility

Use *Spacer*’s additions as scaffolding, not detours.

* Don’t let inventory management overshadow *Wanderer*’s human-scale drama
* Let credits and modules support themes of **survival**, **freedom**, or **temptation**
* Interpret trade routes, faction entanglements, and FTL dangers through the lens of a **wandering soul**, not a profit-driven operator

If something feels too rigid or simulationist, leave it out. The galaxy is vast—and what matters most is why your wanderer keeps moving.
