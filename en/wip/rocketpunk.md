# Loner: Rocketpunk

## Introduction

*A solo roleplaying experience set in a world where the space race never ended.*

What if the Cold War never cooled? What if NASA had kept its promises, and the dream of permanent space habitats became reality? In **Loner: Retrofuture Space**, you step into the vacuum boots of engineers, pioneers, rogues, and visionaries living in a 2025 where rockets never stopped launching. Colonies dot the Moon and Mars. Corporations build orbital arcologies. Asteroid miners work the void. The frontier is real—and dangerous.

Powered by minimalist solo RPG mechanics, *Loner* lets you journal, explore, and survive in a grounded but retrofuturistic timeline inspired by 1960s space speculation, updated through an alternate history lens. Vacuum suits are bulky, comms crackle with static, and control panels still have switches you can flip. It's a future of chrome, sweat, and sacrifice.

Write your mission logs. Salvage derelict stations. Chart rogue satellites. In *Loner: Retrofuture Space*, you’re not playing a myth of the future. You’re playing the future we almost had.

*Loner: Rocketpunk* follows the following design principles:

1. **Portable**: to play you will need a few common (six-sided) dice and writing materials. Anything else is optional and not essential.
2. **Rules-Light**: the game relies on a few rules and only one solving mechanic, easy to learn and eventually to memorize.
3. **Tag-based**: characters and situations are defined only by qualitative descriptors and no quantitative characteristics.

With a focus on quick resolutions, **Loner: Rocketpunk** throws you headfirst into the heart of the action. Your character will be defined by thematic tags, like *Vacuum Specialist*, *Radiation Scarred*, or *Corporate Indentured*.

### What is a Role Playing Game (RPG)?
A role-playing game (RPG) is a type of game in which players assume the roles of fictional characters and act out their actions and decisions within a narrative or imaginary setting. The outcome of these actions and decisions is often determined by a set of rules and game mechanics, such as dice rolls or statistical attributes of the characters. Players may also collaborate to create a shared story or narrative through their characters' actions and interactions.

### What is a Solo RPG?

In a solo RPG a single player takes on the roles of one or more characters, while also simultaneously managing some elements of the game world. These games typically involve the use of a rule system and game mechanics to determine the outcome of actions taken by the player-controlled characters. 
Unlike a gamebook (such as the Fighting Fantasy, Lone Wolf, and Tunnels & Trolls series) a solo RPG is not a form of interactive, forked narrative in which outcomes are pre-determined and limited by the author's choices.

Through the interaction of player, oracle, tools, and prompts, the character's actions will build an **emergent narrative** within whose boundaries anything can be attempted, without predetermined limits.

### Safety Tools
You will play alone, but be sure to play in an environment that is comfortable for you, without overexerting yourself, and reserve the option to stop as soon as you feel uncomfortable for any reason, physical or emotional. Don't be afraid to tackle new themes, but do so in full awareness of your boundaries.

### Minimum Requirements
To play *Loner: Rocketpunk* you will need:
- **4 six sided dice** (also known as d6s): two pairs of different colors
- **Paper and writing tools**: at least a sheet of scrap paper and and pencil, but index cards or sticky notes are a fine addition
- **Character sheet**: you may use the provided sheet at the back or a simple index card.
- **Notebook**: *Loner: Rocketpunk* is not a solo journaling game, you can easily play it in the "theater of mind". But you can keep track of you game if you feel the need!

## The Retrofuture Solar System

In this timeline, the Cold War's space race never cooled down. By 2025, humanity has spread across the solar system in a patchwork of national colonies, corporate habitats, and independent settlements. This is hard science fiction with a retro aesthetic—where vacuum suits are bulky, computers use magnetic tape, and every rivet matters.

### Major Locations and Powers

- **Earth Orbit**: Massive rotating stations house thousands. The *International Space Development Treaty* governs most orbital law, but corporate enclaves operate under their own rules.
- **Luna**: Divided into "zones of stewardship" between major powers. The Soviet *Zvezda-1* base at the south pole faces off against the American *Artemis Base Alpha*. Mining operations extract Helium-3 for fusion reactors.
- **Mars**: Home to permanent settlements like *Endurance* (U.S.) and *Vanguard Habitat* (multinational). The first Martian-born children are now five years old.
- **The Belt**: Asteroid miners work the void around Ceres and Vesta, using robotic prospectors and cramped extraction rigs. Fortunes are made and lost on single rock claims.
- **Outer System**: Research stations around Jupiter's moons study the gas giants. These are the loneliest postings in human space.

### The Orbital Nations Alliance (ONA)
Formed in 2025, the ONA acts as a hybrid UN/regulatory body for interplanetary commerce and conflict resolution. Their blue-and-silver patrol ships enforce salvage law and investigate accidents in the void.

### Technology and Aesthetics
- **Analog Reliability**: Vacuum tubes and mechanical switches dominate spacecraft design due to radiation resistance
- **Retro-Communications**: Radio crackles, magnetic tape whirs, and control panels have satisfying physical switches
- **Bulky EVA Suits**: No sleek spacesuits here—these are industrial workhorses with redundant life support
- **Nuclear Propulsion**: Orion-light drives and fusion torches push ships between worlds
- **Corporate Branding**: Everything from oxygen tanks to habitat modules bears company logos

### Playable Themes

- **Corporate Espionage**: Steal mining surveys, sabotage rival operations, or expose cover-ups
- **Frontier Survival**: Equipment failures, solar storms, and hostile environments test your limits
- **Political Intrigue**: Navigate Cold War tensions that persist even in space
- **Exploration**: Chart new asteroids, investigate derelict stations, or make first contact
- **Labor Struggles**: Corporate indenture, union organizing, and worker's rights in the vacuum
- **Family Drama**: Generational conflicts between Earth-born and space-born populations
- **Rescue Operations**: Coordinate emergency responses to disasters across the solar system

### Timeline

### **1966** – *Point of Divergence*

* Sergei Korolev survives his surgery and returns to lead the Soviet space program with renewed ambition.  
* The N1 rocket program is reorganized under Korolev’s guidance, focusing on reliability and modularity.  
* In the U.S., the Apollo program gains even stronger political backing due to rising Soviet competitiveness.

### **1969** – *Apollo-Soyuz Rivalry Peaks*

* The U.S. lands on the Moon in July, as in our timeline.  
* In response, Korolev announces the goal of a permanent lunar presence by 1975\.  
* Public excitement keeps both space programs politically untouchable.

### **1971–1975** – *Orbital Foundations*

* **U.S.**: Skylab is expanded into a permanent orbital research platform (Skylab II), with shuttle-like logistics via upgraded Saturn IB.  
* **USSR**: Salyut 3 evolves into a true modular station, leading to the Mir-1 prototype.  
* **1975**: Instead of détente, the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project becomes a high-tension orbital standoff during a political crisis in Southeast Asia.

### **1976–1985** – *Lunar Colonization Era*

* **USSR** establishes *Zvezda-1*, a lunar base near the south pole, supplied by improved N1 launches.  
* **U.S.** counters with *Artemis Base Alpha* in 1981, a modular outpost built with Apollo-derived tech.  
* Nuclear thermal propulsion research receives full backing on both sides. The U.S. develops *Project Orion Light*, a less extreme pulsed nuclear concept.  
* Robotic Mars probes become joint civilian-military initiatives.  
* Science fiction culture blossoms: pulp revival, NASA-sponsored comics, and “space westerns.”

### **1986–1995** – *Mars Preparation and the Corporate Shift*

* The **Challenger disaster does not occur**, as shuttles remain cargo-only with enhanced safety.  
* **Soviets launch a Mars flyby mission** in 1991, with cosmonauts surviving 600+ days in space.  
* U.S. begins construction of *Freedom Station*, a rotating artificial gravity hub at L1.  
* **Private investment** begins: aerospace giants like McDonnell Douglas and Boeing enter the orbital cargo market, followed by European and Japanese consortia.

### **1996–2005** – *International Colonization Age*

* The **International Space Development Treaty (ISDT)** is signed, establishing shared protocols for extraterrestrial expansion.  
* **Moon becomes international territory**, but divided by "zones of stewardship."  
* U.S. completes its first **permanent Mars base**, *Endurance*, in 2005, supported by robotic manufacturing on Phobos.  
* Satellite-based solar power arrays begin beaming energy to orbital stations and lunar industry.  
* A new class of astronauts emerges: technicians, farmers, and architects.

### **2006–2015** – *The Age of Expansion*

* Space elevators are under construction in equatorial Africa and South America, based on carbon-fiber advances.  
* **Asteroid mining begins** around Ceres and Vesta, with automated prospector drones launched in 2011\.  
* Artificial gravity ring habitats reach maturity. “Spin cities” in orbit house thousands.  
* Cold War officially ends in 2010 after a massive solar storm requires joint rescue of stranded cosmonauts and astronauts from *Unity Station*.  
* Cultural shift: space service becomes a civic rite of passage in many countries.

### **2016–2025** – *The Retrofuture Now*

* **2020**: The United States, with European and Japanese partners, establishes *Vanguard Habitat* on Mars, a self-sustaining biodome city.  
* **2023**: The first children are born off-Earth—in orbit, on Luna, and one in *Endurance* on Mars.  
* **2025**: The *Orbital Nations Alliance (ONA)* forms, acting as a hybrid UN/ESA/NASA regulator for interplanetary activity.  
* The world economy is now tightly linked with off-Earth resources.  
* Retro-tech remains common: vacuum tubes, redundant analog systems, and mechanical computers still operate in space due to reliability and radiation shielding.  
* You are here.

## Characters

In the vacuum of space, survival depends on competence, redundancy, and knowing when your equipment is about to fail. Whether you're a corporate engineer, asteroid prospector, or ONA investigator, you're defined by your specialization, your gear, and what drives you to risk the black.

### Everything is a Character!

In *Loner: Rocketpunk* Non-Playing Characters (NPCs), Foes, Organizations, Monsters, and even relevant objects like vehicles are characters too!

Your Protagonist is described by some fixed traits:

- **Name**: The name should be iconic and consistent with the tone and setting of the story.
- **Concept**: A concise description of the character's profession, background, and abilities. The best are adjective-name pairings, like *"Veteran Rockhopper"* or *"Indentured Engineer"*.
- **Skills** (x2): Abilities not necessarily character-specific but not characteristics common to all. *"Smart"* is not a skill, *"Thruster Specialist"* is.
- **Frailty**: Something that could potentially get in the way of the character, either physically, mentally, or socially.
- **Gear** (x2): Particular equipment supplied to the character in coherence with the setting. Everyday items are taken for granted and do not fall under this trait.
- **Goal**: The long-term objective.
- **Motive**: What drives the pursuit of the goal.
- **Nemesis**: A person or organization that hinders the protagonist. It can emerge during the first game sessions, it may or may or not be the direct antagonist of the story, ready to appear to make life even more difficult
- **Luck**: The measure of a character's ability to avoid ill fortune or an inauspicious outcome. It applies only in Conflicts and automatically recharges when they end. Luck starts and caps at 6.

These **traits** are described by **tags**, descriptive words or phrases that can identify anything in the game world. Even the **details** of the environment in which the action moves and **conditions** (physical or mental) of the characters are tags. 

**They are qualitative representations. They are not quantitative measures.**

## Rules

*Loner: Rocketpunk* is a minimalist Solo Role Playing Game designed to be played with only one character (the Protagonist). You'll guide them through the story that will unravel during the game, asking closed questions to an Oracle which will help you overturn your expectations.

Every now and then you will be surprised with an unexpected twist!

### Keep The Action In Motion

A game in *Loner: Rocketpunk* is a succession of scenes. 
A scene is a unit of time in which a certain action takes place in pursuit of a certain short-term goal. 

In *Loner: Rocketpunk* at each scene:
1. **Identify what you expect from the scene**. Compared to traits, goal, and motivation determine the Protagonist's action. What might be the reaction of the game world?
2. **Test your expectations**. When you are uncertain (or overconfident) about the reaction to your actions, [ask the Oracle](#consulting-the-oracle) a closed question (answer is Yes or No), considering the tags involved to determine if there is an [Advantage or Disadvantage](#advantage-and-disadvantage).
3. **Interpret the result**. Is the Oracle's answer in line with your expectations? If not, in the context in which the scene takes place, how should an answer that subverts them be considered?

This sequence will come to you naturally after some practice. Use it as a guideline the first few times.

### Consulting the Oracle

When you need to test your expectations you'll ask the Oracle a closed question.

You'll need 2d6 in one color (**Chance Dice**), and 2d6 in another (**Risk Dice**).

To resolve a closed question, roll one **Chance Die** and one **Risk Die**:
- If the Chance Die is highest, the answer is **Yes**. 
- If the Risk Die is highest, the answer is **No**.
- If both are low (3 or less), add a **but...**. 
- If both are high (4 or more), add an **and...**.
- If both are equal, the answer is **Yes, but...**. Add a point to the **[Twist Counter](#twist-counter)**.

| Dice Value |    Chance Die > Risk Die   | Risk Die > Chance Die |
|:----------:|:--------------------------:|:---------------------:|
|  Both < 4  |         Yes, but...        |       No, but...      |
|  Both > 3  |         Yes, and...        |       No, and...      |
| Mismatched |             Yes            |           No          |
|            |                            |                       |
|    Equal   | Add 1 to the Twist Counter |                       |

### Advantage and Disadvantage

If circumstances or positive tags grant an advantage, add a **Chance Die** to the roll. Otherwise, when hindrances or negative tag cause a disadvantage, add a **Risk Die**. In both cases keep only the higher die of the added type when you check the roll.

Consider tags **intuitively and not quantitatively**, using the context of the situation at play. It is important to keep the flow of play fast and not accounting for advantages and disadvantages numerically!

### Twist Counter

The Twist Counter is a measure of the rising tension in the narrative. At the beginning is set to 0. Every time a double throw (dice are equal) happens, add 1 to the Counter. If the Counter is below three, consider the answer as "**Yes, but...**". Otherwise a **Twist** happens and resets the Counter.

Roll 2d6 and consult the following Twist Table to determine what kind of twist happens. 

| D6 |      Subject       |        Action       |
|:--:|:------------------:|:-------------------:|
|  1 |    A third party   |       Appears       |
|  2 |      The hero      | Alters the location |

### Life Support and Environmental Systems

In the vacuum of space, your most dangerous enemy isn't pirates or corporate assassins—it's equipment failure. These rules simulate the constant tension of living in an environment that wants to kill you.

#### Atmosphere and Pressure

Every enclosed space in *Rocketpunk* has an **Atmosphere Rating** that affects actions:

- **Pressurized**: Normal Earth-like atmosphere. No penalties.
- **Low Pressure**: Thin atmosphere or minor leaks. **Disadvantage** on physical exertion.
- **Vacuum**: Hard vacuum or catastrophic breach. Cannot perform most actions without EVA suit.
- **Toxic**: Contaminated atmosphere. Take 1 **Luck** damage per scene without protection.

#### Life Support Crisis Resolution

When life support systems fail, use this procedure:

1. **Determine Severity**: Ask the Oracle *"Is this a gradual failure?"*
   - **Yes**: You have 2d6 scenes to fix it before crisis becomes critical
   - **No**: Immediate danger—you have 1d6 scenes before catastrophic failure

2. **Identify the Problem**: Roll on the **Life Support Failure** table
3. **Find Solutions**: Use your Skills and Gear to attempt repairs
4. **Race Against Time**: Each failed repair attempt reduces remaining scenes by 1

#### Life Support Failure Table

| 2d6 | System | Effect |
|:---:|--------|--------|
| 2-3 | Atmospheric Recycling | Oxygen levels dropping, CO2 rising |
| 4-5 | Pressure Control | Gradual decompression or dangerous overpressure |
| 6-7 | Temperature Regulation | Extreme heat or freezing conditions |

| 10-11 | Power Distribution | Multiple systems failing in cascade |
| 12 | Total Life Support | Everything failing at once—emergency protocols only |

### EVA (Extra-Vehicular Activity) Rules

Working in the vacuum requires special procedures. When performing EVA operations:

- **Suit Check**: Before EVA, ask the Oracle *"Is my equipment functioning normally?"*
- **Tether Protocol**: Untethered EVA grants **Disadvantage** on all physical actions
- **Communication**: Radio has 1-scene delay beyond local area
- **Emergency Air**: EVA suits have 6 scenes of emergency air if primary fails

#### EVA Hazards

Roll 1d6 when the Oracle gives "No, and..." or when a **Twist** occurs during EVA:

| 1d6 | Hazard |
|:---:|--------|
| 1 | Suit puncture—losing air gradually |
| 2 | Thruster malfunction—drifting away from safety |

| 5 | Cargo shift or passenger emergency—immediate attention needed |
| 6 | Unexpected encounter—other ships, debris, or phenomena |

### Industrial Accidents and Disasters

Space is an industrial environment where safety margins are thin and accidents are deadly.

#### Accident Escalation

When industrial accidents occur, they often cascade into larger disasters:

1. **Initial Event**: Equipment failure, human error, or sabotage
2. **Immediate Response**: Crew attempts to contain the problem
3. **Escalation Check**: Ask the Oracle *"Does the problem stay contained?"*

### Conflicts

A *Conflict* is any situation in which opponents clash, attacking, defending, or wearing each other down in order to win.
This applies both in a practical and metaphorical sense. 

So, a Conflict is not only limited to combat (or fighting) in the strict sense but also to competitive situations (such as contests, duels, verbal confrontations, etc.) in which two or more characters (including vehicles, of course!) compete.

Conflicts can be resolved in different ways depending on preferences and context:
1. Ask a single closed question. The Oracle's answer determines the outcome of the conflict.
2. Ask a series of closed questions to resolve current single actions.
3. Use the rules of Harm & Luck below.

Note that the Twist Counter **does not apply** to Harm & Luck. Instead, it is used regularly if the Conflict is handled with closed questions.

If the conflict is resolved by applying damage to the Luck trait, roll the dice to determine whether the protagonist causes damage to the opponent or suffers damage due to counterattack or failed defense. The rolls are player facing only.

The damage reduces the Luck of the target, whether protagonist or NPC. When the Luck runs out, the character has lost the conflict.

The final outcome depends on the context. Do you get caught? Are you seriously injured? You may even die if that fits the narrative.

| Answer      | Do you get what you want?                               | Harm    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Yes, and... | You get what you want, and something else.              | Cause 3 |
| Yes...      | You get what you want.                                  | Cause 2 |
| Yes, but... | You get what you want, but at a cost.                   | Cause 1 |
| No, but...  | You don't get what you want, but it's not a total loss. | Take 1  |
| No...       | You don't get what you were after.                      | Take 2  |
| No, and...  | You don't get what you want, and things get worse.      | Take 3  |

### Determine the mood of the next scene

At the end of the current scene sometimes you will be clear about the direction to take, other times you may need to determine the general mood of the next one. In this case roll 1d6 and consult the following table:

|  D6 |   Next Scene   |
|:---:|:--------------:|
| 1-3 | Dramatic scene |
| 4-5 |   Quiet Scene  |
|  6  |   Meanwhile…   |

- A **dramatic scene** does not break the tension of the previous scene but carries it further forward, introducing further obstacles or difficulties.
- During a **quiet scene** there is time to take a breath, to heal, to make plans for the next steps and to deepen relationships.
- A **meanwhile scene** takes place somewhere else, other than where the hero is. It cuts to villains or other plot-important characters.

### Open-Ended Question or Get Inspired

To answer an Open-Ended question, roll 1d6 once on each of the Inspiration Tables (roll at least a verb and a noun, adjectives are optional).

### When the story ends

At the end of the adventure you may add another trait to the character. It is better that this is related to how the story just ended and can be either a Skill, Gear, a new Frailty, or even a new Nemesis! You can also modify an existing trait to better represent an enhanced expertise.

Also update the list of **NPCs**, **Locations**, and **Events** that may show up again in future adventures.
