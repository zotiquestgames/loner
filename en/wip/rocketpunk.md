# Loner: Rocketpunk

*A solo roleplaying experience set in a world where the space race never ended.*

What if the Cold War never cooled? What if NASA had kept its promises, and the dream of permanent space habitats became reality? In **Loner: Retrofuture Space**, you step into the vacuum boots of engineers, pioneers, rogues, and visionaries living in a 2025 where rockets never stopped launching. Colonies dot the Moon and Mars. Corporations build orbital arcologies. Asteroid miners work the void. The frontier is real‚Äîand dangerous.

Powered by minimalist solo RPG mechanics, *Loner* lets you journal, explore, and survive in a grounded but retrofuturistic timeline inspired by 1960s space speculation, updated through an alternate history lens. Vacuum suits are bulky, comms crackle with static, and control panels still have switches you can flip. It's a future of chrome, sweat, and sacrifice.

Write your mission logs. Salvage derelict stations. Chart rogue satellites. In *Loner: Retrofuture Space*, you‚Äôre not playing a myth of the future. You‚Äôre playing the future we almost had.

## üåç Timeline: *The Retrofuture Space Age*

### **1966** ‚Äì *Point of Divergence*

* Sergei Korolev survives his surgery and returns to lead the Soviet space program with renewed ambition.  
* The N1 rocket program is reorganized under Korolev‚Äôs guidance, focusing on reliability and modularity.  
* In the U.S., the Apollo program gains even stronger political backing due to rising Soviet competitiveness.

### **1969** ‚Äì *Apollo-Soyuz Rivalry Peaks*

* The U.S. lands on the Moon in July, as in our timeline.  
* In response, Korolev announces the goal of a permanent lunar presence by 1975\.  
* Public excitement keeps both space programs politically untouchable.

### **1971‚Äì1975** ‚Äì *Orbital Foundations*

* **U.S.**: Skylab is expanded into a permanent orbital research platform (Skylab II), with shuttle-like logistics via upgraded Saturn IB.  
* **USSR**: Salyut 3 evolves into a true modular station, leading to the Mir-1 prototype.  
* **1975**: Instead of d√©tente, the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project becomes a high-tension orbital standoff during a political crisis in Southeast Asia.

### **1976‚Äì1985** ‚Äì *Lunar Colonization Era*

* **USSR** establishes *Zvezda-1*, a lunar base near the south pole, supplied by improved N1 launches.  
* **U.S.** counters with *Artemis Base Alpha* in 1981, a modular outpost built with Apollo-derived tech.  
* Nuclear thermal propulsion research receives full backing on both sides. The U.S. develops *Project Orion Light*, a less extreme pulsed nuclear concept.  
* Robotic Mars probes become joint civilian-military initiatives.  
* Science fiction culture blossoms: pulp revival, NASA-sponsored comics, and ‚Äúspace westerns.‚Äù

### **1986‚Äì1995** ‚Äì *Mars Preparation and the Corporate Shift*

* The **Challenger disaster does not occur**, as shuttles remain cargo-only with enhanced safety.  
* **Soviets launch a Mars flyby mission** in 1991, with cosmonauts surviving 600+ days in space.  
* U.S. begins construction of *Freedom Station*, a rotating artificial gravity hub at L1.  
* **Private investment** begins: aerospace giants like McDonnell Douglas and Boeing enter the orbital cargo market, followed by European and Japanese consortia.

### **1996‚Äì2005** ‚Äì *International Colonization Age*

* The **International Space Development Treaty (ISDT)** is signed, establishing shared protocols for extraterrestrial expansion.  
* **Moon becomes international territory**, but divided by "zones of stewardship."  
* U.S. completes its first **permanent Mars base**, *Endurance*, in 2005, supported by robotic manufacturing on Phobos.  
* Satellite-based solar power arrays begin beaming energy to orbital stations and lunar industry.  
* A new class of astronauts emerges: technicians, farmers, and architects.

### **2006‚Äì2015** ‚Äì *The Age of Expansion*

* Space elevators are under construction in equatorial Africa and South America, based on carbon-fiber advances.  
* **Asteroid mining begins** around Ceres and Vesta, with automated prospector drones launched in 2011\.  
* Artificial gravity ring habitats reach maturity. ‚ÄúSpin cities‚Äù in orbit house thousands.  
* Cold War officially ends in 2010 after a massive solar storm requires joint rescue of stranded cosmonauts and astronauts from *Unity Station*.  
* Cultural shift: space service becomes a civic rite of passage in many countries.

### **2016‚Äì2025** ‚Äì *The Retrofuture Now*

* **2020**: The United States, with European and Japanese partners, establishes *Vanguard Habitat* on Mars, a self-sustaining biodome city.  
* **2023**: The first children are born off-Earth‚Äîin orbit, on Luna, and one in *Endurance* on Mars.  
* **2025**: The *Orbital Nations Alliance (ONA)* forms, acting as a hybrid UN/ESA/NASA regulator for interplanetary activity.  
* The world economy is now tightly linked with off-Earth resources.  
* Retro-tech remains common: vacuum tubes, redundant analog systems, and mechanical computers still operate in space due to reliability and radiation shielding.  
* You are here.
