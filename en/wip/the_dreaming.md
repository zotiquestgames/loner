# Loner: The Dreaming

***Loner: The Dreaming*** is a solo tabletop RPG adventure set in the shifting landscapes of dreams, where symbols, memories, and fears twist into living realities.

This minimalist Solo Role Playing Game is designed to capture the strangeness and logic of dreams—part surreal exploration, part personal reflection, part nightmare.

## Introduction

*Loner: The Dreaming* follows the following design principles:

1. **Portable**: to play you will need a few common (six-sided) dice and writing materials. Anything else is optional and not essential.
2. **Rules-Light**: the game relies on a few rules and only one solving mechanic, easy to learn and eventually to memorize.
3. **Tag-based**: characters and situations are defined only by qualitative descriptors and no quantitative characteristics.

With a focus on quick resolutions, **Loner: The Dreaming** casts you adrift in a world of unstable realities. Your character will be defined by thematic tags, such as *“Restless Sleeper,”* *“Dream-Walker,”* or *“Haunted Child.”*

### What is a Role Playing Game (RPG)?

A role-playing game (RPG) is a type of game in which players assume the roles of fictional characters and act out their actions and decisions within a narrative or imaginary setting. The outcome of these actions and decisions is often determined by a set of rules and game mechanics, such as dice rolls or statistical attributes of the characters. Players may also collaborate to create a shared story or narrative through their characters' actions and interactions.

### What is a Solo RPG?

In a solo RPG a single player takes on the roles of one or more characters, while also simultaneously managing some elements of the game world. These games typically involve the use of a rule system and game mechanics to determine the outcome of actions taken by the player-controlled characters.
Unlike a gamebook (such as the *Fighting Fantasy*, *Lone Wolf*, and *Tunnels & Trolls* series) a solo RPG is not a form of interactive, forked narrative in which outcomes are pre-determined and limited by the author's choices.

Through the interaction of player, oracle, tools, and prompts, the character's actions will build an **emergent narrative** within whose boundaries anything can be attempted, without predetermined limits.

### Safety Tools

You will play alone, but be sure to play in an environment that is comfortable for you, without overexerting yourself, and reserve the option to stop as soon as you feel uncomfortable for any reason, physical or emotional. Don't be afraid to tackle new themes, but do so in full awareness of your boundaries.

### Minimum Requirements

To play *Loner: The Dreaming* you will need:

* **4 six sided dice** (also known as d6s): two pairs of different colors
* **Paper and writing tools**: at least a sheet of scrap paper and pencil, but index cards or sticky notes are a fine addition
* **Character sheet**: you may use the provided sheet at the back or a simple index card.
* **Notebook**: *Loner: The Dreaming* is not a solo journaling game, you can easily play it in the "theater of mind." But you can keep track of your game if you feel the need!

## Setting Introduction

Dreams are lands without maps, stitched from memory, fear, and stray imagination. Each dream shifts as you walk through it, reshaping itself according to hidden rules you only half understand. One moment you are back in your childhood home, the next you are climbing endless stairs, chased by someone whose face you almost recognize.

In *Loner: The Dreaming*, the setting is not fixed. It is built scene by scene as the dream unfolds. Still, certain elements recur—symbols, archetypes, and distortions that mark the border between the subconscious and the waking world.

### Core Aspects of the Setting

* **Unstable Realities**

  * Landscapes transform suddenly: streets lead into forests, oceans rise inside living rooms, mirrors open into corridors.
  * Every scene may introduce a distortion: a familiar place twisted by surreal logic.

* **Symbolic Figures**

  * People you know appear in altered roles: a friend as betrayer, a teacher as savior, a stranger as your double.
  * Archetypal presences—The Pursuer, The Doubter, The Betrayer—may return across different dreams.

* **Dream Keys and Tokens**

  * Objects carry shifting meanings. A feather may let you fly in one dream, or mark you as prey in another.
  * Items rarely stay consistent, but they always carry weight.

* **The Waking Frame**

  * Each dream session begins with a waking-world concern: a question, fear, or unresolved matter.
  * The dream serves as a crucible where the subconscious struggles with that concern.

* **Distortion and Collapse**

  * As the dream deepens, reality frays. Traits mutate, places melt, and allies turn hostile.
  * The Nemesis—whether a nightmare presence or a symbol of unresolved guilt—eventually intrudes.

### Playable Themes

* **Personal Subconscious Journeys** — confront fears, regrets, and hidden desires.
* **Surreal Dream Quests** — travel through shifting dreamlands in search of lost truths.
* **Nightmares and Archetypes** — face symbolic antagonists that return in new forms.
* **Lucidity and Escape** — try to take control of the dream, or risk being swept along until it collapses.

### Timeline

There is no linear history in *The Dreaming*. Instead, dreams echo fragments of past, present, and possible future. Events recur in altered forms, like memories refracted through a prism. A timeline might look like:

* **Long Ago** — Ancient symbols and myths woven into dreamscapes.
* **Recent Past** — Personal memories resurfacing, distorted.
* **The Present** — Echoes of waking concerns intrude.
* **The Future** — Premonitions, false or true, flicker through shifting scenes.

The timeline is not a sequence but a spiral: the same moments revisited under new masks.

## Characters

In *Loner: The Dreaming*, your protagonist is not fixed. Dreams reshape identity as much as they reshape places. Who you are at the start may not be who you are when you wake.

You might begin as a **Restless Sleeper**, only to become a **Mirror-Walker** or a **Child Lost in Corridors** as the dream mutates. Tags are unstable, and identity itself becomes part of play.

### Everything is a Character!

In *Loner: The Dreaming* Non-Playing Characters (NPCs), symbolic figures, archetypal foes, and even objects like doors, clocks, or shadows are characters too.

Your Protagonist is described by some fixed traits—though they may mutate:

* **Name**: Fluid and unstable. You may change names during play.
* **Concept**: A short phrase, often symbolic (*“Wanderer of Forgotten Halls”*).
* **Skills** (x2): Dreamlike talents (*“Wolf-Tamer,”* *“Mirror Reader”*).
* **Frailty**: A recurring weakness (*“Fear of Falling”*).
* **Gear** (x2): Symbolic items that shift meaning (*“Feather of a Crow,”* *“Clock Without Hands”*).
* **Goal**: The subconscious quest (*to recover a memory, escape pursuit, or find someone lost*).
* **Motive**: The inner drive (*curiosity, guilt, longing*).
* **Nemesis**: An archetypal presence (*The Pursuer, The Doubter, The Betrayer*).
* **Luck**: The measure of your ability to resist collapse. Starts and caps at 6.

These **traits** are described by **tags**, qualitative descriptors that can identify anything in the dream world. Even conditions (*weightless, voiceless, pursued by shadows*) are tags.

**They are not numbers. They are fragments of dream imagery.**

## Rules

*[Title]* is a minimalist Solo Role Playing Game designed to be played with only one character (the Protagonist). You'll guide them through the story that will unravel during the game, asking closed questions to an Oracle which will help you overturn your expectations.

Every now and then you will be surprised with an unexpected twist!

### Keep The Action In Motion

A game in *[Title]* is a succession of scenes. 
A scene is a unit of time in which a certain action takes place in pursuit of a certain short-term goal. 

In *[Title]* at each scene:
1. **Identify what you expect from the scene**. Compared to traits, goal, and motivation determine the Protagonist's action. What might be the reaction of the game world?
2. **Test your expectations**. When you are uncertain (or overconfident) about the reaction to your actions, [ask the Oracle](#consulting-the-oracle) a closed question (answer is Yes or No), considering the tags involved to determine if there is an [Advantage or Disadvantage](#advantage-and-disadvantage).
3. **Interpret the result**. Is the Oracle's answer in line with your expectations? If not, in the context in which the scene takes place, how should an answer that subverts them be considered?

This sequence will come to you naturally after some practice. Use it as a guideline the first few times.

### Consulting the Oracle

When you need to test your expectations you'll ask the Oracle a closed question.

You’ll need 2d6 in one color (**Chance Dice**), and 2d6 in another (**Risk Dice**).

To resolve a closed question, roll one **Chance Die** and one **Risk Die**:
- If the Chance Die is highest, the answer is **Yes**. 
- If the Risk Die is highest, the answer is **No**.
- If both are low (3 or less), add a **but...**. 
- If both are high (4 or more), add an **and...**.
- If both are equal, the answer is **Yes, but...**. Add a point to the **[Twist Counter](#twist-counter)**.


| Dice Value |    Chance Die > Risk Die   | Risk Die > Chance Die |
|:----------:|:--------------------------:|:---------------------:|
|  Both < 4  |         Yes, but...        |       No, but...      |
|  Both > 3  |         Yes, and...        |       No, and...      |
| Mismatched |             Yes            |           No          |
|            |                            |                       |
|    Equal   | Add 1 to the Twist Counter |                       |

### Advantage and Disadvantage

If circumstances or positive tags grant an advantage, add a **Chance Die** to the roll. Otherwise, when hindrances or negative tag cause a disadvantage, add a **Risk Die**. In both cases keep only the higher die of the added type when you check the roll.

Consider tags **intuitively and not quantitatively**, using the context of the situation at play. It is important to keep the flow of play fast and not accounting for advantages and disadvantages numerically!

### Twist Counter

The Twist Counter is a measure of the rising tension in the narrative. At the beginning is set to 0. Every time a double throw (dice are equal) happens, add 1 to the Counter. If the Counter is below three, consider the answer as "**Yes, but...**". Otherwise a **Twist** happens and resets the Counter.

Roll 2d6 and consult the following Twist Table to determine what kind of twist happens. 

| D6 |      Subject       |        Action       |
|:--:|:------------------:|:-------------------:|
|  1 |    A third party   |       Appears       |
|  2 |      The hero      | Alters the location |
|  3 |    An encounter    |    Helps the hero   |
|  4 |  A physical event  |   Hinders the hero  |
|  5 | An emotional event |   Changes the goal  |
|  6 |      An object     |    Ends the scene   |

Interpret the two-word sentence in the context of the current scene. Twists will keep the plot and events going in unexpected ways.

### Dream Distortion
At the end of each scene, roll 1d6 to mutate the dream. Apply one result, then describe how tags support it.


1. **Identity shifts**. Randomly select one of your traits (1 Concept, 2 Skill A, 3 Skill B, 4 Frailty, 5 Gear A, 6 Gear B) and rewrite its tag with a dreamlike twist. Keep intent but change form. You may keep a one-line note of the original for later recall.
2. **Place morphs**. Add a new environmental tag that meaningfully alters the scene or the next one (burning sky, echoing corridors, weightless space). Remove a prior environmental tag if it feels replaced.
3. **Figure returns altered**. Bring back any NPC, ally, or foe seen before, but change one trait or role. If they were helpful, they now hinder; if hostile, they may assist for a price.
4. **Physics bends**. Choose or roll: thin gravity, looping time, muted sound, inverted colors. For the next scene, relevant actions suffer Disadvantage when working against the bend and gain Advantage when working with it.
5. **Symbolic weather**. Choose or roll: rain of ash, hail of ticking cogs, flood of ink, wind that steals words. For the next scene, introduce one obstacle or opportunity tied to it.
6. **Nemesis intrusion**. The Nemesis appears in a new guise. Immediately ask a closed question about its objective this scene. If you wish to avoid the confrontation, you may concede a cost now: lose 1 Luck or discard a Dream Key for the remainder of the session.


### Dream Keys
Dream Keys are symbolic items whose meaning shifts. When you invoke a Key:
- Ask: **Does the Key favor me now?** Resolve with the Oracle.
- **Yes, and...** Choose two: gain Advantage; create or remove an environmental tag; reveal a hidden path; cancel a consequence just established.
- **Yes...** Choose one from the list above.
- **Yes, but...** The Key works, but introduces a new complication related to its symbolism.
- **No, but...** The Key fails, yet grants a clue or softens the setback.
- **No...** It misfires; the scene tilts against you in a symbolic way.
- **No, and...** It turns on you; the Nemesis or environment exploits it immediately.


A Key can also be **charged**. When its symbol naturally appears in a scene, mark a charge. Spend a charge to treat a neutral roll as **Yes** before modifiers, once.


### Archetypal Nemesis
Define the Nemesis as an archetype, not a single identity. Give it two tags that express role and method, for example: The Pursuer + Cold Patience.


**Manifestation (1d6):** 1 familiar face turned hostile, 2 animal predator, 3 masked figure, 4 your double, 5 whispering presence, 6 symbolic ruin.


Each time the Nemesis intrudes and remains unresolved at scene end, mark 1 tally. At 3 tallies, it claims a **domain**: add a persistent environmental tag that recurs until you confront and overcome the Nemesis in a dedicated scene.


### Identity Flux
Once per scene, when doubles are rolled or Dream Distortion triggers, you may voluntarily trigger Identity Flux. Choose one:
- Rewrite a Skill to better fit the situation and gain Advantage on the very next roll that uses it.
- Intensify your Frailty for this scene; in exchange, take +1 Luck recovery at the end of the current conflict.
- Anchor a single tag for this scene to prevent it from mutating again.


### Lucidity Meter (optional)
Track Lucidity from 0 to 6. Start at 3.
- **Gaining Lucidity**: act with awareness of the dream or leverage symbolism cleverly. On a **Yes** result tied to that action, +1 Lucidity (max 6).
- **Losing Lucidity**: succumb to fear, accept a Nemesis bargain, or misread a symbol. On a **No, and...** in such moments, -1 Lucidity (min 0).


Benefits and pressures:
- At **5–6**: once per scene, prevent a Distortion result or lock one tag for the scene; once per session, negate Disadvantage after rolling and reroll the Risk die.
- At **0–1**: at the start of scenes, roll 1d6; on 1–2 the Nemesis intrudes or physics bends immediately.


### The Waking Stakes
Before play, frame a waking concern: Memory, Decision, Fear, Relationship, or Task. Phrase it as a question. The session ends when either a clear answer emerges in play, Nemesis tally reaches 3 and forces collapse, or you choose to wake and accept uncertainty. On ending, update the character per core rules and note one consequence in the waking world.


### Dream Journeys
When crossing a larger dreamland, pick a path type and resolve its procedure.
- **Stairways**: endurance and direction. Ask if you ascend without losing purpose. On **No** results, a floor repeats or inverts.
- **Rivers**: surrender and passage. Ask if the current carries you where you intend. On **Yes, but...**, you arrive changed; mutate one tag.
- **Labyrinths**: pattern and memory. Ask if you recognize a pattern that leads you on. On **No, but...**, you find a helpful center with a price.
- **Mirrors**: reflection and cost. Ask if you can pass without trading something. On **Yes, and...**, you keep what you trade and gain insight.


### Nightmares and Waking
If the Twist Counter triggers twice in a row, or the Nemesis intrudes while Lucidity is 0, trigger **Nightmare Collapse**. Choose or roll 1d6 consequence applied at session end: 1 wake breathless and lose a Gear tag, 2 wake with a new Frailty, 3 wake resolved about the Waking Stake, 4 mark a Nemesis domain tag in future dreams, 5 swap one Skill for a new one, 6 start next session at Lucidity 5.

### Dream Symbol Oracle
Optionally flavor Oracle outcomes with a symbol to guide interpretation. Roll 2d6 and combine column and row.


| 2d6 | Symbol | Suggestion |
|:---:|----------|--------------------------------------------|
| 2 | Masks | Roles reverse or identities are traded |
| 3 | Water | Emotions flood or cleanse the path |
| 4 | Fire | Purify, destroy, or reveal the hidden |
| 5 | Keys | Access, denial, price to be paid |
| 6 | Doors | Thresholds, choices, or forced detours |
| 7 | Mirrors | Reflection, duplication, or inversion |
| 8 | Threads | Connection, fate, or entanglement |
| 9 | Birds | Messages, freedom, or being hunted |
| 10 | Clocks | Time pressure, repetition, or stasis |
| 12 | Crowns | Authority, burden, or responsibility |


### Lucidity Meter

Your Protagonist tracks their awareness of being in a dream on a **Lucidity scale**.

* Start at **Unaware**.
* Each time you encounter paradoxes, contradictions, or impossible events, test if your awareness increases. On a Yes, move up one step: *Unaware → Suspecting → Lucid → Overlucid*.
* At **Lucid**, you may alter or resist one dream element per scene.
* At **Overlucid**, your control risks breaking the dream apart: each alteration may cause a **Distortion** roll, potentially tearing the fabric of the dream.

### Recurring Dreams

The Dreaming is structured in **cycles**:

* Symbols, NPCs, and motifs return across sessions.
* When one reappears, note it as a **Recurring Tag**.
* Each Recurring Tag accumulates weight: three appearances tie it permanently to your Dreamer’s story (e.g. “the cracked mirror always returns”).
* Recurring Tags may become anchors for goals or nemeses, or even form a **Dream Identity** independent from the waking self.

### Nightmare Collapse

If distortions accumulate or a Nemesis overwhelms you, the dream risks collapsing.

* Track **Nightmare Points** when you fail to resist fear, take harm, or distort reality excessively.
* At 6 Nightmare Points, trigger **Collapse**:

  * The dream shatters into fragments.
  * Roll 1d6 to determine the outcome: exile into waking life, entrapment in an endless loop, or rebirth in a warped dream.
* Collapse is the natural “endgame” of the campaign, though survival may open into another Dreaming cycle.

### Dream Journeys

When moving through dreamlands larger than a single scene — rivers, staircases, labyrinths, skies:

* Treat each transition as a **Journey Phase**.
* Roll once per phase to reveal obstacles: shifting landscapes, guardians, riddles, or transformations.
* Each successful passage deepens the strangeness: mark **Journey Tags** (e.g. “the river whispers secrets,” “the stairs fold back on themselves”).
* Three Journey Tags accumulated in sequence generate a **Dream Region**, a recurring location to be revisited in future sessions.

### Conflicts

A *Conflict* is any situation in which opponents clash, attacking, defending, or wearing each other down in order to win.
This applies both in a practical and metaphorical sense. 

So, a Conflict is not only limited to combat (or fighting) in the strict sense but also to competitive situations (such as contests, duels, verbal confrontations, etc.) in which two or more characters (including vehicles, of course!) compete.

Conflicts can be resolved in different ways depending on preferences and context:
1. Ask a single closed question. The Oracle's answer determines the outcome of the conflict.
2. Ask a series of closed questions to resolve current single actions.
3. Use the rules of Harm & Luck below.

Note that the Twist Counter **does not apply** to Harm & Luck. Instead, it is used regularly if the Conflict is handled with closed questions.

If the conflict is resolved by applying damage to the Luck trait, roll the dice to determine whether the protagonist causes damage to the opponent or suffers damage due to counterattack or failed defense. The rolls are player facing only.

The damage reduces the Luck of the target, whether protagonist or NPC. When the Luck runs out, the character has lost the conflict.

The final outcome depends on the context. Do you get caught? Are you seriously injured? You may even die if that fits the narrative.

| Answer      | Do you get what you want?                               | Harm    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Yes, and... | You get what you want, and something else.              | Cause 3 |
| Yes...      | You get what you want.                                  | Cause 2 |
| Yes, but... | You get what you want, but at a cost.                   | Cause 1 |
| No, but...  | You don’t get what you want, but it’s not a total loss. | Take 1  |
| No...       | You don’t get what you were after.                      | Take 2  |
| No, and...  | You don’t get what you want, and things get worse.      | Take 3  |

### Determine the mood of the next scene

At the end of the current scene sometimes you will be clear about the direction to take, other times you may need to determine the general mood of the next one. In this case roll 1d6 and consult the following table:

|  D6 |   Next Scene   |
|:---:|:--------------:|
| 1-3 | Dramatic scene |
| 4-5 |   Quiet Scene  |
|  6  |   Meanwhile…   |

- A **dramatic scene** does not break the tension of the previous scene but carries it further forward, introducing further obstacles or difficulties.
- During a **quiet scene** there is time to take a breath, to heal, to make plans for the next steps and to deepen relationships.
- A **meanwhile scene** takes place somewhere else, other than where the hero is. It cuts to villains or other plot-important characters.

### Open-Ended Question or Get Inspired

To answer an Open-Ended question, roll 1d6 once on each of the Inspiration Tables (roll at least a verb and a noun, adjectives are optional).

### When the story ends

At the end of the adventure you may add another trait to the character. It is better that this is related to how the story just ended and can be either a Skill, Gear, a new Frailty, or even a new Nemesis! You can also modify an existing trait to better represent an enhanced expertise.

Also update the list of **NPCs**, **Locations**, and **Events** that may show up again in future adventures.
