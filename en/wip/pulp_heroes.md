# Loner: Pulp Heroes

***Loner: Pulp Heroes*** is a solo tabletop RPG adventure set in the shadow-drenched streets and smoke-choked cities of the 1930s, where masked vigilantes wage a relentless war against crime and corruption.

This minimalist Solo Role Playing Game is designed to plunge you into the dark heart of pulp heroism, where justice comes at the end of a gun and the only law that matters is the one you enforce yourself.

## Introduction

*Loner: Pulp Heroes* follows the following design principles:

1. **Portable**: to play you will need a few common (six-sided) dice and writing materials. Anything else is optional and not essential.
2. **Rules-Light**: the game relies on a few rules and only one solving mechanic, easy to learn and eventually to memorize.
3. **Tag-based**: characters and situations are defined only by qualitative descriptors and no quantitative characteristics.

With a focus on quick resolutions, **Loner: Pulp Heroes** throws you headfirst into the heart of noir action. Your character will be defined by thematic tags like *Shadow Walker*, *Truth Serum*, *Ruthless*, and *Twin .45s*.

### What is a Role Playing Game (RPG)?
A role-playing game (RPG) is a type of game in which players assume the roles of fictional characters and act out their actions and decisions within a narrative or imaginary setting. The outcome of these actions and decisions is often determined by a set of rules and game mechanics, such as dice rolls or statistical attributes of the characters. Players may also collaborate to create a shared story or narrative through their characters' actions and interactions.

### What is a Solo RPG?

In a solo RPG a single player takes on the roles of one or more characters, while also simultaneously managing some elements of the game world. These games typically involve the use of a rule system and game mechanics to determine the outcome of actions taken by the player-controlled characters. 
Unlike a gamebook (such as the Fighting Fantasy, Lone Wolf, and Tunnels & Trolls series) a solo RPG is not a form of interactive, forked narrative in which outcomes are pre-determined and limited by the author's choices.

Through the interaction of player, oracle, tools, and prompts, the character's actions will build an **emergent narrative** within whose boundaries anything can be attempted, without predetermined limits.

### Safety Tools
You will play alone, but be sure to play in an environment that is comfortable for you, without overexerting yourself, and reserve the option to stop as soon as you feel uncomfortable for any reason, physical or emotional. Don't be afraid to tackle new themes, but do so in full awareness of your boundaries.

### Minimum Requirements
To play *Loner: Pulp Heroes* you will need:
- **4 six sided dice** (also known as d6s): two pairs of different colors
- **Paper and writing tools**: at least a sheet of scrap paper and and pencil, but index cards or sticky notes are a fine addition
- **Character sheet**: you may use the provided sheet at the back or a simple index card.
- **Notebook**: *Loner: Pulp Heroes* is not a solo journaling game, you can easily play it in the "theater of mind". But you can keep track of you game if you feel the need!

## The Dark City

The year is 1936. The Great Depression has left its mark on every street corner, but some wounds run deeper than economic hardship. In the sprawling metropolis where you operate, corruption flows like sewage through the gutters, and the line between law and lawlessness has been erased by those with enough money and influence.

• **The Concrete Jungle**: Towering skyscrapers cast permanent shadows over narrow alleys where deals are made in blood and bullets. Art Deco facades hide opium dens, speakeasies that never closed after Prohibition ended, and backroom meetings where the city's true rulers decide who lives and dies.

• **Technology of Terror**: The modern age brings new tools for both hero and villain - radio networks span the city, zeppelins patrol the skies, and experimental weapons emerge from military contracts gone wrong. But for every innovation that promises progress, ten more serve the cause of corruption.

• **The Untouchables**: Police commissioners on mob payrolls, judges who auction verdicts to the highest bidder, and politicians whose campaign promises are written in disappearing ink. The system isn't broken - it's working exactly as intended by those who bought it.

• **Desperate Citizens**: Honest folks caught between the hammer of organized crime and the anvil of corrupt authority. They've stopped believing in heroes because heroes get bought, blackmailed, or buried. They need something different - something that can't be corrupted because it never claimed to be good in the first place.

• **Occult Undercurrents**: Beneath the rational veneer of industrial progress, ancient cults and eldritch societies pull strings from the shadows. Their goals transcend mere money or power - they seek to reshape reality itself, one ritual murder at a time.

### Playable Themes

- **Vigilante Justice**: Operating outside the law because the law has been purchased
- **Dual Identity**: The constant struggle between public face and private war
- **Moral Ambiguity**: Choosing between lesser evils when there are no good options
- **Urban Gothic**: Horror that wears a three-piece suit and owns half the city
- **Pulp Action**: Over-the-top stunts, dramatic confrontations, and impossible escapes
- **Noir Investigation**: Following leads through a maze of lies, betrayal, and murder
- **Class Warfare**: The elite versus everyone else, fought in penthouses and slums
- **Occult Conspiracy**: Ancient evils using modern methods to achieve timeless goals

### Timeline

- **1929**: The Stock Market crashes, but some fortunes grow larger in the chaos
- **1930-1932**: The first masked vigilantes appear as conventional justice fails
- **1933**: The Crimson Brotherhood cult is exposed, then mysteriously forgotten
- **1934**: Police Commissioner Hayes is assassinated; his replacement is twice as corrupt
- **1935**: The Zeppelin Disaster covers up something much worse in the wreckage
- **1936**: Present day - the city bleeds, and only shadows can stop the bleeding

## Characters

In the world of *Loner: Pulp Heroes*, you are not a shining beacon of hope. You are a necessary darkness, a brutal remedy for a diseased city. Your methods are questionable, your morality is flexible, and your enemies know that encountering you means facing judgment without appeal.

### Everything is a Character!

In *Loner: Pulp Heroes* Non-Playing Characters (NPCs), Foes, Organizations, Monsters, and even relevant objects like vehicles are characters too!

Your Protagonist is described by some fixed traits:

- **Name**: The name should be iconic and consistent with the tone and setting of the story.
- **Concept**: A concise description of the character's profession, background, and abilities. The best are adjective-name pairings, like *"Merciless Mentalist"* or *"Cloaked Avenger"*.
- **Skills** (x2): Abilities not necessarily character-specific but not characteristics common to all. *"Smart"* is not a skill, *"Mind Reader"* is.
- **Frailty**: Something that could potentially get in the way of the character, either physically, mentally, or socially.
- **Gear** (x2): Particular equipment supplied to the character in coherence with the setting. Everyday items are taken for granted and do not fall under this trait.
- **Goal**: The long-term objective.
- **Motive**: What drives the pursuit of the goal.
- **Nemesis**: A person or organization that hinders the protagonist. It can emerge during the first game sessions, it may or may or not be the direct antagonist of the story, ready to appear to make life even more difficult
- **Luck**: The measure of a character's ability to avoid ill fortune or an inauspicious outcome. It applies only in Conflicts and automatically recharges when they end. Luck starts and caps at 6.

These **traits** are described by **tags**, descriptive words or phrases that can identify anything in the game world. Even the **details** of the environment in which the action moves and **conditions** (physical or mental) of the characters are tags. 

**They are qualitative representations. They are not quantitative measures.**

## Rules

*Loner: Pulp Heroes* is a minimalist Solo Role Playing Game designed to be played with only one character (the Protagonist). You'll guide them through the story that will unravel during the game, asking closed questions to an Oracle which will help you overturn your expectations.

Every now and then you will be surprised with an unexpected twist!

### Keep The Action In Motion

A game in *Loner: Pulp Heroes* is a succession of scenes. 
A scene is a unit of time in which a certain action takes place in pursuit of a certain short-term goal. 

In *Loner: Pulp Heroes* at each scene:
1. **Identify what you expect from the scene**. Compared to traits, goal, and motivation determine the Protagonist's action. What might be the reaction of the game world?
2. **Test your expectations**. When you are uncertain (or overconfident) about the reaction to your actions, [ask the Oracle](#consulting-the-oracle) a closed question (answer is Yes or No), considering the tags involved to determine if there is an [Advantage or Disadvantage](#advantage-and-disadvantage).
3. **Interpret the result**. Is the Oracle's answer in line with your expectations? If not, in the context in which the scene takes place, how should an answer that subverts them be considered?

This sequence will come to you naturally after some practice. Use it as a guideline the first few times.

### Consulting the Oracle

When you need to test your expectations you'll ask the Oracle a closed question.

You'll need 2d6 in one color (**Chance Dice**), and 2d6 in another (**Risk Dice**).

To resolve a closed question, roll one **Chance Die** and one **Risk Die**:
- If the Chance Die is highest, the answer is **Yes**. 
- If the Risk Die is highest, the answer is **No**.
- If both are low (3 or less), add a **but...**. 
- If both are high (4 or more), add an **and...**.
- If both are equal, the answer is **Yes, but...**. Add a point to the **[Twist Counter](#twist-counter)**.

| Dice Value |    Chance Die > Risk Die   | Risk Die > Chance Die |
|:----------:|:--------------------------:|:---------------------:|
|  Both < 4  |         Yes, but...        |       No, but...      |
|  Both > 3  |         Yes, and...        |       No, and...      |
| Mismatched |             Yes            |           No          |
|            |                            |                       |
|    Equal   | Add 1 to the Twist Counter |                       |

### Advantage and Disadvantage

If circumstances or positive tags grant an advantage, add a **Chance Die** to the roll. Otherwise, when hindrances or negative tag cause a disadvantage, add a **Risk Die**. In both cases keep only the higher die of the added type when you check the roll.

Consider tags **intuitively and not quantitatively**, using the context of the situation at play. It is important to keep the flow of play fast and not accounting for advantages and disadvantages numerically!

### Twist Counter

The Twist Counter is a measure of the rising tension in the narrative. At the beginning is set to 0. Every time a double throw (dice are equal) happens, add 1 to the Counter. If the Counter is below three, consider the answer as "**Yes, but...**". Otherwise a **Twist** happens and resets the Counter.

Roll 2d6 and consult the following Twist Table to determine what kind of twist happens. 

| D6 |      Subject       |        Action       |
|:--:|:------------------:|:-------------------:|
|  1 |    A third party   |       Appears       |
|  2 |      The hero      | Alters the location |
|  3 |    An encounter    |    Helps the hero   |
|  4 |  A physical event  |   Hinders the hero  |
|  5 | An emotional event |   Changes the goal  |
|  6 |      An object     |    Ends the scene   |

Interpret the two-word sentence in the context of the current scene. Twists will keep the plot and events going in unexpected ways.

### Pulp Hero Mechanics

#### Secret Identity
Your hero maintains a dual existence. When operating in their civilian identity, they gain advantage on social interactions but disadvantage on intimidation. When in their hero persona, the reverse is true. Switching identities takes a full scene and requires a safe location.

#### Terror and Intimidation
Pulp heroes inspire fear in criminals. When using intimidation against common thugs or corrupt officials, gain advantage. However, this reputation precedes you - organized crime and occult enemies are prepared for your methods and may have advantage against you.

#### The Code
Most pulp heroes operate by a personal code (never kill, protect innocents, truth above all, etc.). Following your code grants advantage on related rolls, but breaking it causes you to lose 1 Luck immediately and gain the "Guilt" condition until you make amends.

#### Investigation Chains
When investigating, successful oracle questions can create "leads." Track these as tags. Having multiple related leads grants advantage on major revelation attempts, but false leads (from failed questions) give disadvantage.

### Conflicts

A *Conflict* is any situation in which opponents clash, attacking, defending, or wearing each other down in order to win.
This applies both in a practical and metaphorical sense. 

So, a Conflict is not only limited to combat (or fighting) in the strict sense but also to competitive situations (such as contests, duels, verbal confrontations, etc.) in which two or more characters (including vehicles, of course!) compete.

Conflicts can be resolved in different ways depending on preferences and context:
1. Ask a single closed question. The Oracle's answer determines the outcome of the conflict.
2. Ask a series of closed questions to resolve current single actions.
3. Use the rules of Harm & Luck below.

Note that the Twist Counter **does not apply** to Harm & Luck. Instead, it is used regularly if the Conflict is handled with closed questions.

If the conflict is resolved by applying damage to the Luck trait, roll the dice to determine whether the protagonist causes damage to the opponent or suffers damage due to counterattack or failed defense. The rolls are player facing only.

The damage reduces the Luck of the target, whether protagonist or NPC. When the Luck runs out, the character has lost the conflict.

The final outcome depends on the context. Do you get caught? Are you seriously injured? You may even die if that fits the narrative.

| Answer      | Do you get what you want?                               | Harm    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Yes, and... | You get what you want, and something else.              | Cause 3 |
| Yes...      | You get what you want.                                  | Cause 2 |
| Yes, but... | You get what you want, but at a cost.                   | Cause 1 |
| No, but...  | You don't get what you want, but it's not a total loss. | Take 1  |
| No...       | You don't get what you were after.                      | Take 2  |
| No, and...  | You don't get what you want, and things get worse.      | Take 3  |

### Determine the mood of the next scene

At the end of the current scene sometimes you will be clear about the direction to take, other times you may need to determine the general mood of the next one. In this case roll 1d6 and consult the following table:

|  D6 |   Next Scene   |
|:---:|:--------------:|
| 1-3 | Dramatic scene |
| 4-5 |   Quiet Scene  |
|  6  |   Meanwhile…   |

- A **dramatic scene** does not break the tension of the previous scene but carries it further forward, introducing further obstacles or difficulties.
- During a **quiet scene** there is time to take a breath, to heal, to make plans for the next steps and to deepen relationships.
- A **meanwhile scene** takes place somewhere else, other than where the hero is. It cuts to villains or other plot-important characters.

### Open-Ended Question or Get Inspired

To answer an Open-Ended question, roll 1d6 once on each of the Inspiration Tables (roll at least a verb and a noun, adjectives are optional).

### When the story ends

At the end of the adventure you may add another trait to the character. It is better that this is related to how the story just ended and can be either a Skill, Gear, a new Frailty, or even a new Nemesis! You can also modify an existing trait to better represent an enhanced expertise.

Also update the list of **NPCs**, **Locations**, and **Events** that may show up again in future adventures.
