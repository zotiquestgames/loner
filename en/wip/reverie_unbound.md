# Reverie Unbound

***Reverie Unbound*** is a solo tabletop RPG adventure set in a vertically fragmented magitech world, where floating sanctuaries, corporate arcologies, and ancient submerged vaults pulse with unstable ether and forgotten power.

This minimalist Solo Role Playing Game is designed to capture the epic scope and wonder of classic JRPGs, where heroes traverse vast worlds on magnificent steeds and soaring airships.

## Introduction

*Reverie Unbound* follows the following design principles:

1. **Portable**: to play you will need a few common (six-sided) dice and writing materials. Anything else is optional and not essential.
2. **Rules-Light**: the game relies on a few rules and only one solving mechanic, easy to learn and eventually to memorize.
3. **Tag-based**: characters and situations are defined only by qualitative descriptors and no quantitative characteristics.

With a focus on quick resolutions, **Reverie Unbound** throws you headfirst into the heart of the action. Your character will be defined by thematic tags, Exiled Summoner, Bound to a Lost Engine, Last Heir of the Vault, or Marked by the Third Pulse.

### What is a Role Playing Game (RPG)?
A role-playing game (RPG) is a type of game in which players assume the roles of fictional characters and act out their actions and decisions within a narrative or imaginary setting. The outcome of these actions and decisions is often determined by a set of rules and game mechanics, such as dice rolls or statistical attributes of the characters. Players may also collaborate to create a shared story or narrative through their characters' actions and interactions.

### What is a Solo RPG?

In a solo RPG a single player takes on the roles of one or more characters, while also simultaneously managing some elements of the game world. These games typically involve the use of a rule system and game mechanics to determine the outcome of actions taken by the player-controlled characters. 
Unlike a gamebook (such as the Fighting Fantasy, Lone Wolf, and Tunnels & Trolls series) a solo RPG is not a form of interactive, forked narrative in which outcomes are pre-determined and limited by the author's choices.

Through the interaction of player, oracle, tools, and prompts, the character's actions will build an **emergent narrative** within whose boundaries anything can be attempted, without predetermined limits.

### Safety Tools
You will play alone, but be sure to play in an environment that is comfortable for you, without overexerting yourself, and reserve the option to stop as soon as you feel uncomfortable for any reason, physical or emotional. Don't be afraid to tackle new themes, but do so in full awareness of your boundaries.

### Minimum Requirements
To play *Reverie Unbound* you will need:
- **4 six sided dice** (also known as d6s): two pairs of different colors
- **Paper and writing tools**: at least a sheet of scrap paper and pencil, but index cards or sticky notes are a fine addition
- **Character sheet**: you may use the provided sheet at the back or a simple index card.
- **Notebook**: *Reverie Unbound* is not a solo journaling game, you can easily play it in the "theater of mind". But you can keep track of you game if you feel the need!

## Characters

In *Reverie Unbound*, you are more than a collection of stats—you are a living remnant of a fractured world, shaped by ether storms, lost pacts, and collapsing regimes. Whether you're a salvager from the Glass Wastes, a summoner hunted by your own Eidolons, or a drifter caught in the slow implosion of the Spire-Cities, your character emerges from a world where survival is political, and identity is mutable.

Every choice you make carries echoes of the past—and may awaken forces that should have stayed buried.

### Everything is a Character!

In *Reverie Unbound* Non-Playing Characters (NPCs), Foes, Organizations, Monsters, and even relevant objects like vehicles are characters too!

Your Protagonist is described by some fixed traits:

- **Name**: The name should be iconic and consistent with the tone and setting of the story.
- **Archetype**: Defines your character’s starting role, with specific skills and gear inspired by JRPG tropes and adapted to the fractured world of *Reverie Unbound*. It sets your foundation, not your limits.
- **Concept**: A concise description of the character's profession, background, and abilities. The best are adjective-name pairings, like *"Venturous Smuggler"* or *"Child Prodigy"*.
- **Skills** (x2): Abilities not necessarily character-specific but not characteristics common to all. *"Smart"* is not a skill, *"Engine Whisperer"* is.
- **Frailty**: Something that could potentially get in the way of the character, either physically, mentally, or socially.
- **Gear** (x2): Particular equipment supplied to the character in coherence with the setting. Everyday items are taken for granted and do not fall under this trait.
- **Goal**: The long-term objective.
- **Motive**: What drives the pursuit of the goal.
- **Nemesis**: A person or organization that hinders the protagonist. It can emerge during the first game sessions, it may or may or not be the direct antagonist of the story, ready to appear to make life even more difficult
- **Luck**: The measure of a character's ability to avoid ill fortune or an inauspicious outcome. It applies only in Conflicts and automatically recharges when they end. Luck starts and caps at 6.
- **Mana**: Measures your ether reserves. Spells and summoning cost Mana Points (MP). You start with 6 MP, fully restored after rest. Casting at 0 MP risks failure and backlash.

These **traits** are described by **tags**, descriptive words or phrases that can identify anything in the game world. Even the **details** of the environment in which the action moves and **conditions** (physical or mental) of the characters are tags. 

**They are qualitative representations. They are not quantitative measures.**

## Sub-Tags

### Locked Sub-Tags
At character creation, all sub-tags are **locked** - they exist as potential within your traits but cannot be actively used for Advantage in Oracle rolls.

### Unlocking Sub-Tags
Sub-tags represent specialized aspects of your abilities that unlock through experience:

#### Unlock Conditions
- **Narrative Achievement**: Successfully use a trait in a way that relates to the sub-tag
- **Intensive Training**: Spend a quiet scene focused on developing that specific aspect
- **Mystical Awakening**: Oracle-driven breakthrough during dramatic moments
- **Mentorship**: Learn from an NPC who possesses similar abilities

#### Using Unlocked Sub-Tags
- **Advantage Bonus**: When the sub-tag directly applies to a situation, gain Advantage on Oracle rolls
- **Narrative Authority**: Unlocked sub-tags give you more creative control over outcomes
- **Specialized Actions**: Attempt actions that would be impossible without the sub-tag

### Example of Sub-Tag Progression
**Character**: Warrior with "Combat Mastery" skill
**Starting**: All sub-tags (Sword Techniques, Shield Arts, Berserker Rage) are locked
**Session 3**: After successfully defending allies in multiple battles, unlock "Shield Arts"
**Session 5**: During a climactic duel, unlock "Sword Techniques" through intensive combat
**Session 8**: After witnessing a friend's death, unlock "Berserker Rage" through traumatic awakening

## Character Progression

### End of Adventure Advancement
After completing a significant story arc, characters may choose ONE of the following:

#### 1. Evolve an Existing Trait
Transform a current trait into a more powerful or specialized version:
- **Blade Mastery** → **Legendary Swordplay** → **Transcendent Warrior**
- **Healing Arts** → **Divine Restoration** → **Life Giver**
- **Signature Weapon** → **Awakened Blade** → **Soul-Bonded Artifact**

Evolution reflects how the character's experiences have deepened their understanding or power in that area.

Gain a completely new Skill or Gear based on your adventures:
- **New Skills**: Abilities learned through experience, training, or revelation
- **New Gear**: Equipment gained, crafted, or inherited during the story
- **Hybrid Traits**: Combinations that reflect unique character development

New traits should emerge naturally from the character's journey and actions.

#### 3. Unlock a Sub-Tag

## Core Rules

*Reverie Unbound* is a minimalist Solo Role Playing Game designed to be played with only one character (the Protagonist). You'll guide them through the story that will unravel during the game, asking closed questions to an Oracle which will help you overturn your expectations.

Every now and then you will be surprised with an unexpected twist!

### Keep The Action In Motion

A game in *Reverie Unbound* is a succession of scenes. 
A scene is a unit of time in which a certain action takes place in pursuit of a certain short-term goal. 

In *Reverie Unbound* at each scene:
1. **Identify what you expect from the scene**. Compared to traits, goal, and motivation determine the Protagonist's action. What might be the reaction of the game world?
2. **Test your expectations**. When you are uncertain (or overconfident) about the reaction to your actions, [ask the Oracle](#consulting-the-oracle) a closed question (answer is Yes or No), considering the tags involved to determine if there is an [Advantage or Disadvantage](#advantage-and-disadvantage).
3. **Interpret the result**. Is the Oracle's answer in line with your expectations? If not, in the context in which the scene takes place, how should an answer that subverts them be considered?

This sequence will come to you naturally after some practice. Use it as a guideline the first few times.

### Consulting the Oracle

When you need to test your expectations you'll ask the Oracle a closed question.

You’ll need 2d6 in one color (**Chance Dice**), and 2d6 in another (**Risk Dice**).

To resolve a closed question, roll one **Chance Die** and one **Risk Die**:
- If the Chance Die is highest, the answer is **Yes**. 
- If the Risk Die is highest, the answer is **No**.
- If both are low (3 or less), add a **but...**. 
- If both are high (4 or more), add an **and...**.
- If both are equal, the answer is **Yes, but...**. Add a point to the **[Twist Counter](#twist-counter)**.


| Dice Value |    Chance Die > Risk Die   | Risk Die > Chance Die |
|:----------:|:--------------------------:|:---------------------:|
|  Both < 4  |         Yes, but...        |       No, but...      |
|  Both > 3  |         Yes, and...        |       No, and...      |
| Mismatched |             Yes            |           No          |
|            |                            |                       |
|    Equal   | Add 1 to the Twist Counter |                       |

### Advantage and Disadvantage

If circumstances or positive tags grant an advantage, add a **Chance Die** to the roll. Otherwise, when hindrances or negative tag cause a disadvantage, add a **Risk Die**. In both cases keep only the higher die of the added type when you check the roll.

Consider tags **intuitively and not quantitatively**, using the context of the situation at play. It is important to keep the flow of play fast and not accounting for advantages and disadvantages numerically!

### Twist Counter

The Twist Counter is a measure of the rising tension in the narrative. At the beginning is set to 0. Every time a double throw (dice are equal) happens, add 1 to the Counter. If the Counter is below three, consider the answer as "**Yes, but...**". Otherwise a **Twist** happens and resets the Counter.

Roll 2d6 and consult the following Twist Table to determine what kind of twist happens. 

| D6 |      Subject       |        Action       |
|:--:|:------------------:|:-------------------:|
|  1 |    A third party   |       Appears       |
|  2 |      The hero      | Alters the location |
|  3 |    An encounter    |    Helps the hero   |
|  4 |  A physical event  |   Hinders the hero  |
|  5 | An emotional event |   Changes the goal  |
|  6 |      An object     |    Ends the scene   |

Interpret the two-word sentence in the context of the current scene. Twists will keep the plot and events going in unexpected ways.

### Conflicts

A *Conflict* is any situation in which opponents clash, attacking, defending, or wearing each other down in order to win.
This applies both in a practical and metaphorical sense. 

So, a Conflict is not only limited to combat (or fighting) in the strict sense but also to competitive situations (such as contests, duels, verbal confrontations, etc.) in which two or more characters (including vehicles, of course!) compete.

Conflicts can be resolved in different ways depending on preferences and context:
1. Ask a single closed question. The Oracle's answer determines the outcome of the conflict.
2. Ask a series of closed questions to resolve current single actions.
3. Use the rules of Harm & Luck below.

Note that the Twist Counter **does not apply** to Harm & Luck. Instead, it is used regularly if the Conflict is handled with closed questions.

If the conflict is resolved by applying damage to the Luck trait, roll the dice to determine whether the protagonist causes damage to the opponent or suffers damage due to counterattack or failed defense. The rolls are player facing only.

The damage reduces the Luck of the target, whether protagonist or NPC. When the Luck runs out, the character has lost the conflict.

The final outcome depends on the context. Do you get caught? Are you seriously injured? You may even die if that fits the narrative.

| Answer      | Do you get what you want?                               | Harm    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Yes, and... | You get what you want, and something else.              | Cause 3 |
| Yes...      | You get what you want.                                  | Cause 2 |
| Yes, but... | You get what you want, but at a cost.                   | Cause 1 |
| No, but...  | You don’t get what you want, but it’s not a total loss. | Take 1  |
| No...       | You don’t get what you were after.                      | Take 2  |
| No, and...  | You don’t get what you want, and things get worse.      | Take 3  |

### Determine the mood of the next scene

At the end of the current scene sometimes you will be clear about the direction to take, other times you may need to determine the general mood of the next one. In this case roll 1d6 and consult the following table:

|  D6 |   Next Scene   |
|:---:|:--------------:|
| 1-3 | Dramatic scene |
| 4-5 |   Quiet Scene  |
|  6  |   Meanwhile…   |

- A **dramatic scene** does not break the tension of the previous scene but carries it further forward, introducing further obstacles or difficulties.
- During a **quiet scene** there is time to take a breath, to heal, to make plans for the next steps and to deepen relationships.
- A **meanwhile scene** takes place somewhere else, other than where the hero is. It cuts to villains or other plot-important characters.

### Open-Ended Question or Get Inspired

To answer an Open-Ended question, roll 1d6 once on each of the Inspiration Tables (roll at least a verb and a noun, adjectives are optional).

### When the story ends

At the end of the adventure you may add another trait to the character. It is better that this is related to how the story just ended and can be either a Skill, Gear, a new Frailty, or even a new Nemesis! You can also modify an existing trait to better represent an enhanced expertise.

Also update the list of **NPCs**, **Locations**, and **Events** that may show up again in future adventures.

## JRPG Spell Casting System for Loner

### Magic in the World

Magic flows through the world like an ancient current, channeled by those who have learned to attune themselves to its rhythms. Spells are not mere formulas but expressions of will shaped by knowledge, experience, and inner power.

### Character Magic Traits

#### Spells Known
Characters possess specific spells as traits, learned through study, training, or mystical awakening:
- **Spells Known** (x3-4): Choose from the spell lists below, such as "Firaga", "Curaga", "Haste", "Barrier"
- Spells represent your character's magical repertoire and provide the foundation for casting

#### Mana Points (MP)
- **Starting MP**: 6 points
- **Maximum MP**: 6 points (like Luck)
- **Recovery**: Full MP restored after rest or quiet scenes
- **Items/Abilities**: Some gear or skills may restore MP during scenes

### Casting Spells

#### The Casting Process
1. **Declare Intent**: State which spell you're casting and your desired outcome
2. **Check MP**: Determine if you have sufficient mana (see spell costs below)
3. **Ask the Oracle**: Frame as a closed question: "Do I successfully cast [Spell Name] on [Target]?"
4. **Apply Modifiers**: Add Advantage/Disadvantage based on circumstances
5. **Interpret Results**: Apply both the Oracle outcome and any consequences

#### Mana Costs
- **Minor Spells**: 1 MP (Fire, Cure, Scan)
- **Major Spells**: 2 MP (Fira, Cura, Haste, Barrier)
- **Powerful Spells**: 3 MP (Firaga, Curaga, Meteor, Ultima)

#### Casting Conditions
- **High MP (4-6)**: Cast with Advantage on Oracle rolls
- **Low MP (1-3)**: Cast normally, standard Oracle results
- **No MP (0)**: Cast with Disadvantage, higher risk of negative consequences

### Oracle-Driven Spell Outcomes

#### Success Levels
- **Yes, and...**: Spell succeeds spectacularly, creates additional beneficial effects or environmental tags
- **Yes**: Spell works as intended, achieves desired outcome
- **Yes, but...**: Spell succeeds but creates minor complications or temporary frailties
- **No, but...**: Spell fails but you avoid serious backlash or learn something useful
- **No**: Spell fails, MP is lost, no additional effects
- **No, and...**: Spell backfires, creating negative environmental tags or serious frailties

#### Spell-Generated Tags
Successful spells create temporary tags that influence the narrative:

**Beneficial Tags (from successful casts):**
- "Magically Shielded" (Barrier, Shell)
- "Accelerated" (Haste)
- "Restored" (Cure spells)
- "Fire-wreathed" (Fire spells)
- "Blessed" (Holy spells)
- "Invisible" (Vanish)

**Negative Tags (from failures or complications):**
- "Mana Burned" (overexertion)
- "Spell Backlash" (dangerous failures)
- "Magically Unstable" (repeated failures)
- "Cursed" (dark magic consequences)
- "Elementally Drained" (elemental spell overuse)

### Spell Consequences and Frailties

#### Temporary Frailties from Magic Use
Magic always carries risk. Failed spells or overuse can create temporary frailties:

- **"Mana Exhausted"**: From casting at 0 MP repeatedly
- **"Spell Shock"**: From powerful spell failures
- **"Magically Vulnerable"**: From protective spell failures
- **"Elemental Weakness"**: From elemental spell backlash
- **"Soul Weary"**: From summoning or necromantic failures

#### Recovery
- Most magical frailties fade after a quiet scene or rest

- Items, skills, or other characters may help recover from magical ailments

### Example of Play

*"The ancient golem is bearing down on us. I want to cast Firaga to destroy it before it reaches the bridge."*

**Check**: You have "Firaga" in your Spells Known, and 4 MP remaining.
**Cost**: Firaga costs 3 MP, leaving you with 1 MP.
**Oracle Question**: "Do I successfully cast Firaga on the golem?"
**Advantage**: You have "Fire Magic Focus" gear, so you roll with Advantage.
**Result**: Yes, and...

**Interpretation**: Not only does your Firaga blast the golem apart, but the intense heat also melts the ice blocking the passage beyond. The golem gains the "Molten Wreckage" tag, and you gain the "Fire-wreathed" tag from channeling such power, though you now have the "Magically Drained" frailty from the effort.

### Integration with Conflicts

During conflicts, spells can be used as actions within the Harm & Luck system:
- Offensive spells attempt to cause Harm to enemies
- Healing spells restore Luck to allies
- Support spells create advantageous tags for subsequent actions
- The Oracle determines both magical success and combat effectiveness

### Spell Progression

As your character advances, you may:
- Learn new spells as additional traits
- Upgrade existing spells (Fire → Fira → Firaga)
- Gain gear that reduces MP costs or enhances magical ability
- Develop new frailties related to magical overuse or specific spell schools

## Summoning

### Summoning Overview

Summoning magic calls forth powerful entities from other realms to aid the caster. Unlike regular spells, summoning requires significant preparation, personal connection, and spiritual energy, making it a rare and dramatic form of magic.

### Summoning Constraints

#### Summoning Pacts
Before any summon can be called, the caster must establish a **Pact** with the entity. This requires:
- **Discovery**: Find the summon's shrine, defeat it in combat, or complete a quest
- **Bonding Ritual**: Spend time establishing mutual respect and understanding
- **Pact Sealing**: Exchange of spiritual energy that creates the summoning bond

#### Summoning Requirements
Each summoning attempt requires:
1. **MP Cost**: Standard mana expenditure (varies by summon)
2. **Summoning Focus**: Special item or location that aids the connection
3. **Spiritual Strain**: Temporary reduction of maximum MP after use
4. **Cooldown Period**: Time must pass before the same summon can be called again

#### Summoning Mechanics

##### Summoning Check
To successfully summon an entity:
1. **Pay MP Cost**: Expend required mana points
2. **Oracle Question**: "Does the summoning succeed?"
   - **Advantage**: If you have the summon's focus item or are at a sacred site
   - **Disadvantage**: If you're injured, stressed, or in an unsuitable environment
3. **Interpret Result**: Success brings the summon, failure wastes MP and may have consequences

##### Summoning Strain
After any summoning attempt (successful or not):
- **Reduce Maximum MP by 1** for the remainder of the current adventure
- **Cooldown**: Cannot summon the same entity again for 24 hours

### Travel Between World Levels

The fragmented world is divided into three vertical strata: **The Nether**, **The Middleworld**, and **The Heaven**. Moving between them requires advanced technology, specific conditions, or narrative improvisation. Not all travel is legal or safe.

### Skyship Travel

Skyships are the most stable means of level transition.

* **Middleworld ⇄ Heaven**: Authorized routes exist between Spire-Cities and Floating Sanctuaries. Access requires guild credentials, elite permits, or government clearance.
* **Heaven ⇄ Nether**: Extremely rare and restricted. Only high-grade military or research-class vessels can withstand the turbulent descent.
* **Unauthorized Travel**: Smuggler skyships and rogue pilots may offer illicit passage. Ask the Oracle: *“Can I find someone willing to take me across levels?”*

#### Teleportation Circles

Ancient arcane networks sometimes link distant layers of the world.

* **Conditions**: Function only when properly attuned, and often require *Focusing Stones* or matching circle pairs.
* **Stability**: Roll with **Disadvantage** in corrupted zones or under leyline stress.
* **Access**: Forbidden Summons, elite mages, or relic artifacts may bypass circle limitations.

### Wind Gliders & Personal Flight

These lightweight flight tools can ascend or descend between layers — with risk.

* **Middleworld → Heaven**: Possible from mountaintops or spire-towers during fair weather. Ask Oracle with possible Disadvantage.
* **Heaven → Middleworld**: Easier to descend, though glider control is required to avoid lethal descent speed or thermal currents.
* **Not viable for Nether access** due to pressure shifts and arcane distortion fields.

#### Deep Rails & Vertical Arcanodes

Some Spire-Cities contain ancient sealed routes into the Nether.

* **Deep Elevators**: Guarded by corporations or state forces. Often locked behind keycard systems or ritual glyphs.
* **Arcane Spiral Transports**: Occasionally reactivated during crises. Their pathways may shift unpredictably through old ley-paths.

#### Summoned or Living Mounts

Exceptional creatures may ignore vertical limits.

* **Dragon Mounts**, wind spirits, or fusion-summoned beasts can ascend or descend through story-justified means.
* Oracle roll required to succeed without consequence. Apply Frailty or cooldown if misused.

#### Environmental Tags for Vertical Travel

Use these tags to describe the tension, limitations, or cost of transitioning between levels:

* *Restricted Airspace*
* *Seal-Bound Elevator*
* *Leyfield Interference*
* *Illegal Descent Capsule*
* *Gravity Disruption Zone*
* *Smuggler’s Drop Path*

## World-Ending Threat

In the grand tradition of JRPGs, heroes don't just save villages or kingdoms—they prevent the complete annihilation of existence itself. The World-Ending Threat is the cosmic horror that looms over everything, growing stronger as the story progresses, demanding increasingly desperate measures to stop.

### What is a World-Ending Threat?

A World-Ending Threat is not merely a powerful enemy or natural disaster. It represents:

- **Existential annihilation**: The complete destruction or fundamental alteration of reality
- **Escalating urgency**: Growing stronger and more imminent over time
- **Cosmic scope**: Affecting multiple worlds, dimensions, or the fabric of existence itself
- **Personal stakes**: Threatening everything the protagonist holds dear
- **Ultimate test**: Requiring the hero to transcend their limitations
- **Narrative climax**: The central conflict around which the entire story revolves

### Threat Characteristics

Every World-Ending Threat is defined by:

#### Core Traits
- **Name**: The threat's designation (often revealed gradually)
- **Nature**: What fundamental force or entity it represents
- **Manifestation**: How it appears in the world
- **Agenda**: Its ultimate goal or purpose
- **Countdown**: Current progress toward completion (1-10 scale)
- **Harbingers**: Early warning signs and lesser manifestations
- **Catalyst**: What event or condition triggered its awakening
- **Weakness**: The theoretical means of stopping it (often unknown initially)

#### Threat Levels
As the threat grows, it passes through distinct phases:

**Dormant** (Countdown 1-2): Ancient evil stirs, omens appear
**Awakening** (Countdown 3-4): Active influence begins affecting the world
**Rising** (Countdown 5-6): Widespread destruction and chaos
**Imminent** (Countdown 7-8): Reality itself begins to break down
**Apocalyptic** (Countdown 9-10): The final stages before total annihilation

### Threat Countdown System

The Countdown represents how close the threat is to achieving its goal. It advances through:

#### Automatic Progression
- **Time Passage**: Countdown advances by 1 every few major story beats
- **Inaction**: Failing to take steps against the threat accelerates it
- **Catalyst Events**: Specific world events that push the threat forward

#### Triggered Advancement
Ask the Oracle: "Does the threat grow stronger?" when:
- Major story milestones are reached
- The protagonist gains significant power
- Artifacts are awakened or artifacts are destroyed

#### Countdown Effects

## Core Setting

The world of *Loner: Reverie Unbound* is a broken sphere of strata and scars — a vertically fragmented planet where the ancient collision of magic and technology created both wonders and wounds. Ether, the lifeblood of civilization, is harvested, weaponized, worshipped, and feared. From skyborn sanctuaries to crystalline deserts, from corporate arcologies to biopunk wilds, every layer of the world is shaped by its past — and by the pressure of what comes next.

This is a setting of arcane reactors, summonable titans, broken pacts, and layered ruins. Of people modified by biotech, warped by ether exposure, or divided by altitude and access. Of railguns and rituals, rebellion and prophecy.

You are a drifter, a chosen, a fugitive, a remnant — one life pulled into a chain of events that may trigger the **Third Pulse**, or stop it.

### Playable Themes

*Loner: Reverie Unbound* supports a wide range of JRPG-inspired storylines. These themes can shape your character's concept, goals, and tone of play:

* **Lost Technology**: Seek forbidden relics of the Divine Engine era
* **Resistance & Rebellion**: Topple Spire-City regimes or expose ether monopolies
* **Summoner’s Burden**: Forge bonds with ancient entities at great personal cost
* **Wounded Worlds**: Journey through unstable zones and dying ecosystems
* **Identity & Transformation**: Discover your post-human lineage or awaken inner power
* **Fragmented Memory**: Recover lost pasts, overwritten truths, or hacked realities
* **Fated Echoes**: Intersect with timelines, prophecies, or leyline awakenings

These are not rigid campaigns, but narrative seeds. Choose what resonates — your story will emerge from the decisions you make and the forces you confront.

### Timeline

The history of the world unfolds in distinct but overlapping epochs. Each era left behind technologies, myths, or traumas that continue to shape the present.

#### **The First Pulse** *(\~3000+ years ago)*

The age of primordial ether flow.

* Ether first discovered as a raw, volatile force emanating from leylines.
* Early cultures attempted to channel it through song, ritual, and intuition.
* Monolithic proto-structures still found deep in the Nether.
* Some believe humanity was reshaped by exposure, creating divergence into current cultures.

**Legacy**: *Untranslated glyph-cores, forgotten Eidolons, pulse-stabilized ruins*

#### **The Age of Divine Engines** *(\~2000–1200 years ago)*

A golden age of integration between magic and engineering.

* First magitech civilizations rise — floating citadels, ley-powered cities, biomechanical fauna.
* Artificial gods (Divine Engines) created to govern ether flow and climate balance.
* War breaks out as rival nations attempt to seize control of the Engines.
* Ends with a catastrophic resonance event ("The Echo") that shatters the upper atmosphere and floods the Nether.

**Legacy**: *Forbidden summoning frames, unstable engine cores, corrupted guardian programs*

#### **The Cataclysmic Reign** *(\~1000–300 years ago)*

Aftermath and descent into fragmentation.

* Global infrastructure collapses. Sky cities fall, ley-lines rupture, weather destabilizes.
* Survivors retreat into Spire-Cities, underground bunkers, or wild exclusion zones.
* Myths about the Divine Engines become religion, heresy, or propaganda.
* Multiple failed attempts to unify the world under a single banner (The Triarchy War, The Ether Purge Crusade).

**Legacy**: *Shattered diplomatic trust, wild ether zones, nomad kinship lines*

#### **The Stratification Era** *(\~300–50 years ago)*

The world settles into vertical castes and controlled chaos.

* The Ascendancy rises to dominate the skies, codifying ether purity laws.
* The Consortium reestablishes stable trade routes and infrastructure in the Middleworld.
* The Verdant Communion declares sovereignty over Exclusion Zones.
* Myrrik kinships and Eshkai descentholds develop parallel survival cultures.
* The Nether Union formally reactivates and establishes non-invasion protocols.

**Legacy**: *Codified borders, airspace restrictions, factional identity enforcement*

#### **The Current Crisis** *(Present Day)*

Unstable equilibrium under strain.

* Ether levels are dropping in controlled zones but surging in forbidden areas.
* Multiple Divine Engine fragments have reawakened or destabilized.
* Border skirmishes and energy raids occur between Spire-Cities and communion outposts.
* Sightings of new summonable entities and unpredictable atmospheric phenomena.
* Whispered prophecies speak of the **Third Pulse**, a return or rupture of the world’s core flow.

**Ongoing Conflicts**:

* **Ascendancy vs. Verdant Communion**: ideological and ecological warfare.
* **Consortium internal fracture**: sabotage, blackmail, rogue labs.
* **Unstable ley-node eruptions** in the Nether and Glass Wastes.
* **Myrrik prophecy cults** interpreting cosmic alignments and machine dreams.
* **Rogue summoners** seeking to reactivate forbidden Eidolons.

### Geography

The world is vertically fragmented and tectonically unstable — a stratified planet broken into three main levels by ancient cataclysms and unchecked ether exploitation. Each layer expresses different facets of civilization, survival, and collapse.

#### **The Nether**

The lowest level of the world, composed of submerged cities, underground caverns, and arcane catacombs. A place of myth, decay, and hidden power.

* **Sunken Empire**: Once a pinnacle of civilization, now submerged beneath dark waters. Sealed constructs and echoing machines still operate deep below the waves.
* **Forgotten Depths**: Massive caverns and underlayers where ether accumulates unnaturally. Monsters thrive in this twilight realm. Many dungeons, ancient bunkers, and ritual zones lie here.
* **Access Points**: Only Spire-Cities and elite Skyships retain access to the Nether, and only through rare, sanctioned descents.

#### **The Middleworld**

The primary inhabited layer — a patchwork of ruined biomes, arcological spires, and unstable exclusion zones.

* **Spire-Cities**: Self-contained vertical city-states powered by ether. Social strata are literal — corporate arcana rules the heights, while laborers and synth-punks survive the lower tiers.
* **Verdant Exclusion Zones**: Nature reasserting itself violently. Giant flora, mutated beasts, and unstable ley-field storms. Human access is restricted or suicidal without special gear.
* **Glass Wastes**: Once-vibrant plains now petrified by arcane resonance. Entire regions turned to brittle, glowing crystal. Rumors speak of preserved cities within.
* **Transit Rails & Skyducts**: Relics of a former global infrastructure — some still operable, most host to scavengers or rogue automata.

#### **The Heaven**

Above the clouds float sanctuaries of privilege, power, and control. Built on stabilized skyplates and wind-channeling ether pylons, they house the elite.

* **Floating Sanctuaries**: Luxurious cities, research facilities, and aristocratic retreats. Appear serene from below — but many hide experiments, vaults, and repressive agendas.
* **Extraction Fields**: Moving sky-platforms that skim ambient ether from high-altitude currents or harvest it from skybeasts.
* **Drifting Temples**: Vestiges of forgotten beliefs or AI-run observatories, kept airborne by unknown means.

### Cultures & Peoples

The peoples of the world are shaped by their position in the stratified structure of society, their access to ether technology, and their adaptation to fragmented geography. These cultures are not “races” in the classic fantasy sense, but complex social lineages, bioengineered morphotypes, and philosophical adaptations to a collapsing magitech ecology.

#### **Humans**

* **Where They Live**: Everywhere, but most common in Middleworld settlements and Skyship trade hubs
* **Core Traits**: Adaptive, diverse, pragmatic
* **Ether Relationship**: Varies wildly — some fear it, others build their lives around it
* **Aesthetic Notes**: No single look, but often incorporate local tech or fashion into their style

Humans remain the statistical majority and the baseline from which many cultural offshoots diverged. Their role in political power, commerce, and resistance varies by region.

#### **Varnari**

* **Where They Live**: Deep within the Verdant Exclusion Zones
* **Core Traits**: Biotechnic symbiosis, decentralized memory, ritual ecology
* **Ether Relationship**: Revere *wild ether* flows; shun refinement and corporate use
* **Aesthetic Notes**: Bark-patched skin, mossy filaments, glowing mycelial veins

The Varnari live in communion with the last autonomous zones of nature. They encode memory in plants, sing to awaken feral ley-nodes, and sometimes strike back against ecological trespassers.

#### **Haldrith**

* **Where They Live**: Lower tiers of Spire-Cities and transit underlayers
* **Core Traits**: Social camouflage, survival instinct, scavenger innovation
* **Ether Relationship**: Bound to disposable tech; often test unstable prototypes
* **Aesthetic Notes**: Neon-thread implants, custom cyberware, multitone eye-flicker

Haldrith emerged from urban abandonment — human in origin, but long shaped by exposure to uncontrolled ether surges and rogue firmware. Their clans form shifting, encrypted alliances.

#### **Onir**

* **Where They Live**: Submerged Nether ruins and abyssal sanctums
* **Core Traits**: Amphibious bodies, shared dream archives, ritual silence
* **Ether Relationship**: Naturally attuned to dormant systems and submerged constructs
* **Aesthetic Notes**: Smooth, translucent skin, visible pulse-lines, coral or nacre growths

Once human, now something else, the Onir navigate flooded ruins with ease. They act as guardians of forgotten data and secret vaults, but rarely speak aloud — their language is mnemonic.

#### **Caelissar**

* **Where They Live**: Floating Sanctuaries and Heaven-class enclaves
* **Core Traits**: Engineered perfection, political elegance, dynastic obsession
* **Ether Relationship**: Inherit exclusive access to pure ether reserves and research tech
* **Aesthetic Notes**: Bio-sculpted forms, chrome-veined skin, ceremonial filigree

Descendants of elite human houses and early ether-ascension projects, the Caelissar are cultured, radiant, and ruthlessly hierarchical. They fund most arcane-engineering advancements — and suppress access.

#### **Myrrik**

* **Where They Live**: Nomadic circuits across the Glass Wastes and broken leyfields
* **Core Traits**: Oral-historian clans, hybrid tech rituals, autonomous logistics
* **Ether Relationship**: Harness broken or forbidden tech for movement and survival
* **Aesthetic Notes**: Layered cloaks, vox-chime masks, mirrored ocular lenses

The Myrrik travel light but carry deep knowledge, encoded into music, gesture, and map-tattoos. They often hold the only surviving record of events erased by war, meltdown, or decree.

#### **Eshkai**

* **Where They Live**: Hanging colonies in vertical shafts near Nether fault-lines
* **Core Traits**: Endurance, industrial mythology, communal stoicism
* **Ether Relationship**: Direct exposure to raw ether-crystal seams; suffer from mutation or sickness
* **Aesthetic Notes**: Hardened exo-suits, sigil-burned skin, breathing flares

The Eshkai live where no one else will — hanging above the void in ancient mining shells, maintaining rituals that keep the walls from collapsing. Some say they were once miners; others, prisoners.

### Political Entities

Power in the fractured world is distributed unequally across city-states, floating regimes, and subterranean remnants. While traditional kingdoms have vanished, their ideological descendants now compete across layers, using magitech, ether rights, and cultural dominance as tools of control.

#### **1. The Ascendancy of Caelis**

* **Type**: Floating Oligarchy
* **Seat**: *Altara Solis* (Floating Sanctuary)
* **Government**: Hereditary technocratic elite (Caelissar High Houses)
* **Core Doctrine**: Ether purity, divine right of ascent
* **Military Arm**: The Halo Guard (aerial security corps with summoned support)

A cloudborne regime that views itself as steward of civilization. Controls ether filtration and refinement. Allows trade but demands tribute, loyalty, or gene pledges from partners.

#### **2. Consortium of Spires**

* **Type**: Corporate Federation
* **Seat**: *Vell-Circuit Spire* (Middleworld)
* **Government**: Executive board of five megacorporations
* **Core Doctrine**: Efficiency, containment of ether leakage, IP protection
* **Military Arm**: Proxy Security Forces (automated drones + freelance PMCs)

The true economic engine of the Middleworld. They license technology, dominate transportation, and manipulate global narratives through media-arcanes. Rivals with the Ascendancy but economically entangled.

#### **3. Verdant Communion**

* **Type**: Eco-synthetic Theocracy
* **Seat**: *Verd Cleft*, a mobile canopy-city grown inside the Exclusion Zone
* **Government**: Matrilineal councils and mycelial oracles
* **Core Doctrine**: Regrowth through balance, rejection of ether industry
* **Military Arm**: Biothorn Regenerants and symbiotic beastkin

Considered rogue radicals by most Middleworld powers, they oppose arcane industrialization and advocate for post-tech rewilding. Rumors suggest deep alliances with Varnari elders and sapient flora.

#### **4. The Nether Union**

* **Type**: Arcane-Survivor Confederation
* **Seat**: *Aegir Vault*, an ancient ley-core facility in the Nether
* **Government**: Rotating representatives from submerged factions
* **Core Doctrine**: Protection of the old world, containment of sealed knowledge
* **Military Arm**: Leviathan Command and Depthbound Scions

Composed of Onir factions, rogue archivists, and reactivated defense protocols. Mostly isolationist but will strike with devastating force if surface factions intrude on sealed vaults.

#### **5. Myrrik Nomad Kinships**

* **Type**: Distributed Data-Clan Network
* **Seat**: None (constantly mobile)
* **Government**: Council-of-Voices convened via encoded rituals
* **Core Doctrine**: Preservation of oral-truth chains, self-determination
* **Military Arm**: Rapid-response artifact teams and bonded guardians

Refuse fixed borders. Transport memory, knowledge, and resources across shattered regions. Serve occasionally as mediators, but some factions sell intelligence to the highest bidder.

#### **6. Eshkai Descentholds**

* **Type**: Vertical Fortress-Collectives
* **Seat**: *Gravemark Coil*, suspended over an active fault-line
* **Government**: Steelbound Oaths sworn to hereditary stone-lords
* **Core Doctrine**: Survival, sacrifice, silence
* **Military Arm**: Descentguard and Pulsebreaker Units

The Eshkai keep to themselves, guarding collapsed infrastructure and dead elevators. They despise surface politics but can be hired for high-risk salvage or structural stabilization operations.

### Factions

#### Halo Directorate

* **Concept**: Sanctified Enforcers
* **Skills**: Ether Regulation, High-Altitude Combat
* **Frailty**: Rigid Chain of Command
* **Gear**: Radiant Harness, Authority Sigil
* **Goal**: Maintain ether purity and ideological order
* **Motive**: Belief in divine hierarchy and skybound stewardship
* **Nemesis**: Verdant Communion

A militant branch of the Ascendancy of Caelis, the Halo Directorate enforces arcane law from above, acting as peacekeepers, strike teams, and purifiers. They control access to floating sanctuaries and deploy summoned constructs for area suppression. To defy them is to risk being *sealed* — both physically and socially.

#### Verdant Flame

* **Concept**: Radical Symbiotes
* **Skills**: Biotic Warfare, Hive-Tongue Diplomacy
* **Frailty**: Incompatible with synthetic systems
* **Gear**: Living Thornmail, Pulse-Spores
* **Goal**: Overgrow and reclaim industrial zones
* **Motive**: Restore balance between machine and life
* **Nemesis**: Halo Directorate

An offshoot of the Verdant Communion, the Verdant Flame functions like a decentralized cult-cell network. Members are part plant, part insurgent. They infiltrate urban structures and awaken dormant flora to break the concrete grip of civilization. Some see them as terrorists, others as prophets.

#### Cobalt Veil

* **Concept**: Obscured Operatives
* **Skills**: Info Scrubbing, Surveillance Subversion
* **Frailty**: Internal Distrust
* **Gear**: Cloaking Mantle, Memory Bleed Dart
* **Goal**: Expose Divine Engine conspiracies
* **Motive**: Truth must disrupt false orders
* **Nemesis**: Consortium of Spires

A clandestine network of rogue technomancers, former archivists, and burned agents. The Cobalt Veil operates beneath the grid, tracing leyline anomalies and leaking forbidden truths. They specialize in temporal fragments, erased records, and identity disruption. Most consider them myth — until something *scrubs your face from every system*.

#### Forgebound Pact

* **Concept**: Bound Artificers
* **Skills**: Enchantment Craft, Relic Recovery
* **Frailty**: Loyalty Clauses
* **Gear**: Pact-Linked Gauntlet, Binding Core Token
* **Goal**: Reconstruct a controllable Divine Engine
* **Motive**: Restore the golden age of ethercraft
* **Nemesis**: Myrrik Kinships

The Forgebound Pact is an ancient guild bound by literal contracts — written in arcane code and sealed to the soul. Its members are artisans, salvagers, and designers working to retrieve, adapt, or rebuild lost wonders. But every tool they master binds them tighter to the Pact’s secret goals.

#### Scales of Gesh

* **Concept**: Draconic Arbitrators
* **Skills**: Ritual Combat, Pact Negotiation
* **Frailty**: Arcane Obsession
* **Gear**: Eidolon's Brand, Echo-Forged Halberd
* **Goal**: Prevent the return of the Third Pulse
* **Motive**: Stabilize the leyflow through personal trial
* **Nemesis**: Rogue Summoners

An order of warrior-priests descended from pact-binders of the Divine Engine age. The Scales of Gesh uphold balance between summonable forces and mortal will. They challenge rogue summoners to trial-by-Eidolon and serve as neutral arbiters in summon wars. To fight one is to risk judgment — and banishment to the Nether.

#### Aethric Chorus

* **Concept**: Networked Visionaries
* **Skills**: Mind-Link Broadcast, Oracle Cultivation
* **Frailty**: Psychic Feedback
* **Gear**: Chorus Coil Array, Dissonance Spike
* **Goal**: Synchronize global consciousness
* **Motive**: Eliminate conflict through collective thought
* **Nemesis**: Eshkai Descentholds

What began as a philosophical experiment became a memetic movement. The Aethric Chorus transmits shared cognition through harmonized neural implants and song-code protocols. While some join willingly, others are assimilated. The Chorus believes that only when all voices are one can the future be reached — but not everyone consents to the tune.

| 22  | A door appears where none existed — and it’s open                   |
| 23  | All written language becomes unreadable to you                      |

| 32  | You receive a cryptic transmission from your future self            |

#### Dream Intrusions

| D66 | Intrusion Description                                        |

| 16  | You dream of an Eidolon not bound to you                     |
| 21  | Your Nemesis begs for your help in a collapsing dreamscape   |
| 22  | A childhood memory is overwritten by an alien scene          |
| 23  | The dream ends with you being erased                         |
| 24  | You speak a language you don’t know — fluently               |
| 25  | You are being watched from behind your own eyes              |
| 26  | A massive door opens into a void and whispers your fate      |
| 31  | You witness the Third Pulse from orbit                       |
| 32  | The dream insists that one of your allies is a fraud         |
| 33  | You meet yourself — and they warn you not to continue        |
| 34  | You relive a past failure, but events change                 |
| 35  | The stars in the dream sky form a map                        |

| 45  | You wake with a symbol burned into your memory               |
| 46  | Every object in the dream has your name inscribed on it      |
| 51  | A looping scene repeats, changing one small thing each time  |
| 52  | The dream ends with your real body breaking apart            |
| 53  | You cannot speak — but everyone understands your thoughts    |
| 54  | You wake up elsewhere — with no memory of arriving           |
| 55  | A dream Eidolon offers you a forbidden pact                  |
| 56  | Someone is clearly trying to break into your mind            |
| 61  | The dream reveals a version of reality where you failed      |
| 62  | You encounter an NPC who claims they are dreaming you        |
| 63  | You see a future battle you’re destined to lose              |
| 64  | You are called by a child who hasn’t been born yet           |
| 65  | You awaken holding an object from the dream                  |
| 66  | The dream continues after you wake — and so does the damage  |

| 43  | You were once part of the enemy faction                          |
| 44  | Your name had a different meaning — with power attached          |
| 45  | You recall leading a rebellion… and failing                      |
| 46  | You remember seeing a Divine Engine up close                     |

| 56  | You remember the trigger of a world-ending event                 |
| 61  | Your earliest memory has changed — something was added           |
| 62  | You once swore never to return to this place — but forgot        |
| 63  | You clearly remember holding a weapon you’ve never seen          |
| 64  | An entire faction considers you a traitor — and now you know why |
| 65  | A symbol or phrase unlocks a flood of hidden memories            |

#### Oracle Gone Wrong

| D66 | Malfunction or Consequence                                 |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| 11  | The Oracle gives an answer in a dead language              |
| 12  | Every roll returns “Yes, and…” — even when implausible     |
| 13  | The dice refuse to roll properly — spinning endlessly      |
| 14  | The Oracle responds before the question is asked           |
| 15  | The result is clearly personal — and accusatory            |
| 16  | “Yes” and “No” switch places for one scene                 |
| 21  | A third dice roll appears — and disagrees with both others |
| 22  | An Eidolon interrupts to answer instead — cryptically      |
| 23  | The Oracle loops one question over and over                |
| 24  | Every “No” causes physical disorientation                  |
| 25  | The Oracle generates a Twist even without doubles          |
| 26  | A previously asked question changes retroactively          |
| 31  | A random NPC reacts violently to your question             |
| 32  | The answer changes the moment you write it down            |
| 33  | You hear the Oracle’s voice from an external source        |
| 34  | One die vanishes mid-roll — the result is incomplete       |
| 35  | “Yes, but…” becomes “Yes, at a terrible cost”              |
| 36  | The Oracle answers with a memory, not a result             |
| 41  | Your next question causes environmental feedback           |
| 42  | The dice bleed a drop of glowing fluid                     |
| 43  | Every question for the rest of the scene returns “Unknown” |
| 44  | The Oracle names a Nemesis unprompted                      |
| 45  | A Twist is triggered — but unrelated to your question      |
| 46  | The Oracle demands a personal sacrifice for clarity        |
| 51  | Oracle results begin to rhyme ominously                    |
| 52  | One die refuses to roll anything above 3 for an hour       |
| 53  | An NPC nearby reacts as if they heard your question aloud  |
| 54  | The Oracle result mirrors your greatest fear               |
| 55  | You are forced to ask your next question out loud          |
| 56  | “Yes, and…” causes time to fracture slightly               |
| 61  | A forgotten Eidolon gives its own answer                   |
| 62  | The Oracle’s result is contradicted by reality             |
| 63  | The dice roll themselves while you sleep                   |
| 64  | A hidden tag is revealed — and you didn’t write it         |
| 65  | The Oracle insists your question has already been answered |
| 66  | All future Oracle results echo with laughter               |

| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 11  | A shrine appears only during ether storms                   |
| 12  | The shrine is guarded by a beast that cannot be remembered  |
| 13  | Touching the shrine’s altar reveals a future death          |
| 14  | The shrine is buried beneath a ruined skyship               |
| 15  | A dream points to its location — but only once              |
| 16  | The shrine sings in response to your Eidolon’s name         |
| 21  | A ghostly child appears near the entrance and vanishes      |
| 22  | It was once used to bind a forbidden summon                 |
| 23  | The shrine’s doors open only to a broken weapon             |
| 24  | Someone you trust denies the shrine exists                  |
| 25  | A rival summoner seeks it — and you                         |
| 26  | Its location shifts slightly each time it’s mapped          |
| 31  | The shrine grants a boon — and a vision of betrayal         |
| 32  | Found near a tree with chrome leaves and no shadow          |
| 33  | Its symbols match a pact you haven’t made — yet             |
| 34  | An old faction war was started over its secrets             |
| 35  | It’s located in a zone declared cursed and sealed off       |
| 36  | Locals whisper the shrine calls those with unfinished pacts |
| 41  | It’s said to host an Eidolon that chooses its summoner      |
| 42  | Found inside a mirrored ruin submerged at low tide          |
| 43  | Accessed only by passing through a wall of light            |
| 44  | The shrine marks the site of a forgotten summoner’s grave   |
| 45  | A floating shard above it echoes your recent dreams         |
| 46  | Only visible when you forget what you’re looking for        |
| 51  | Rumored to alter your pact — without consent                |
| 52  | Locals report glowing steps appearing at dusk               |
| 53  | The shrine mimics a place from your childhood               |
| 54  | The air near it smells like memory — sharp and metallic     |
| 55  | A disbanded cult left maps hinting at its entrance          |
| 56  | It grants knowledge, but replaces a memory to do so         |
| 61  | A beast guards it — and whispers truths in combat           |
| 62  | Found only by walking backwards through a ruined corridor   |
| 63  | Sealed by an unfinished song known only to one NPC          |
| 64  | It's near — but its presence is hidden from Eidolons        |
| 65  | The shrine mirrors its last visitor’s fate in stone         |
| 66  | Inside it, the Third Pulse speaks — and listens             |

| 33  | All oracle rolls yield only “Yes, but...” or “No, but...”              |
| 34  | Elemental effects surge randomly: ice forms, fire ignites, air howls   |
| 35  | Emotional states intensify — fear becomes panic, grief becomes madness |
| 36  | Any Eidolon summoned gains a temporary unknown tag                     |

| 42  | A second sun or false moon becomes visible in the sky                  |

| 63  | Conflict rolls automatically trigger *Yes, and...* or *No, and...*     |

#### Leyline Anomalies

| D66 | Anomaly Description                                                       |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 11  | A leyline abruptly inverts flow, draining Mana instead of channeling it   |
| 12  | Reality thins — echoes of other timelines flicker in view                 |
| 13  | Physical laws bend: water flows upward, gravity tilts sideways            |
| 14  | A summoned Eidolon becomes autonomous — and judgmental                    |
| 15  | All nearby tags become visible as glowing glyphs                          |
| 16  | The ground emits a harmonic pulse felt through your bones                 |
| 21  | Wounds inflicted here vanish — then reappear hours later                  |
| 22  | A dead zone of pure silence interrupts magic and thought                  |
| 23  | Spells cost no Mana — but create instability each time                    |
| 24  | Memories shift — all players recall events differently                    |
| 25  | Leyline energy speaks in your voice, repeating key phrases                |
| 26  | Equipment spontaneously gains or loses enchantments                       |
| 31  | All directional sense becomes unreliable for 1d6 scenes                   |
| 32  | Emotion bleeds into the leyflow — rage becomes flame, sorrow becomes rain |
| 33  | Ghostly figures reenact past events at the node                           |
| 34  | The leyline’s flow splits, duplicating all outcomes                       |
| 35  | A fragment of the Divine Engine pulses from beneath the soil              |
| 36  | Ether crystallizes midair, creating unstable floating shards              |
| 41  | Touching the ground reveals a stranger’s memory                           |
| 42  | Time loops one action until it’s changed deliberately                     |
| 43  | Local Eidolons refuse to manifest unless directly challenged              |
| 44  | Casting a spell here summons echoes of previous casters                   |
| 45  | A summoning circle appears naturally formed in the terrain                |
| 46  | The leyline thrums with a countdown you cannot identify                   |
| 51  | All text within the area rewrites itself into unknown script              |
| 52  | A second you splits from your actions — and disappears                    |
| 53  | Eidolon Focus items resonate and float midair                             |
| 54  | A sudden surge overloads all magic in the area                            |
| 55  | Any question asked aloud is answered — cryptically                        |
| 56  | Faction glyphs flicker across exposed stone and vanish                    |
| 61  | A vault door emerges from solid rock — then sinks again                   |
| 62  | Every spell cast adds 1 to the Twist Counter automatically                |
| 63  | All Gear becomes warm to the touch — even non-magical items               |
| 64  | A memory you’ve lost anchors itself to a spot in the node                 |
| 65  | The node replays the moment of its original rupture                       |
| 66  | The leyline anomaly reaches upward — and watches back                     |

| 53  | Pain echoes — one wound causes another elsewhere             |
| 54  | The area is visible on no current map                        |
| 55  | Entering dreams within the zone triggers physical changes    |
| 56  | Wounds heal backwards, briefly re-opening old scars          |
| 61  | Any summoned creature gains an unintended frailty            |
| 62  | Gravity pulls toward the center of the zone — not downward   |
| 63  | A translucent dome covers the area during certain hours      |
| 64  | Emotional states sync across people — shared fear, joy, rage |
| 65  | Reality briefly tears: background elements loop or glitch    |
| 66  | A divine warning echoes in your mind: “Leave now”            |

| 65  | On exit, everyone outside reacts as if you’ve been gone for days   |
| 66  | You arrive — but something crucial didn’t make the trip            |

| 12  | You dance with a stranger who vanishes at midnight                  |
| 13  | A mask you tried on cannot be removed — and whispers                |

| 12  | A faction declares the countdown already finished                      |

| 26  | The number skips a digit — but no one seems to notice                  |
| 31  | A Rift opens at the exact moment the number drops                      |
| 32  | The next tick affects only your party — no one else reacts             |
| 33  | A previously stable Eidolon becomes corrupted at tick                  |
| 34  | The number starts counting up instead                                  |
| 35  | A warning beacon broadcasts the wrong value — intentionally            |
| 36  | A Twist is automatically triggered at the next tick                    |
| 41  | Your gear records a past Countdown that contradicts history            |
| 42  | Every summoner in the zone hears the tick as a heartbeat               |
| 43  | The air becomes electrified with dread as the number shifts            |
| 44  | A party member begins to glow in sync with the Countdown               |
| 45  | The countdown halts mid-digit and hangs there unnaturally              |
| 46  | A glyph appears at the epicenter — and no one can read it              |

| 52  | A Divine Engine fragment activates unexpectedly                        |
| 53  | Multiple pacts rupture as the number drops                             |
| 54  | You see a possible future with each tick — and lose one with each drop |
| 55  | Local fauna flee exactly when the tick changes                         |
| 56  | A forgotten countdown marker is discovered underground                 |
| 61  | The number counts in a voice you recognize — your own                  |
| 62  | Every device begins showing different numbers                          |
| 63  | You become the anchor of the Countdown — it follows your movement      |
| 64  | An enemy faction triggers a false tick to bait summoners               |
| 65  | The countdown becomes visible in the sky                               |
| 66  | The moment of tick causes silence, then *something arrives*            |

| 13  | Anyone touching it receives flashes of unknown schematics        |
| 14  | A fragment levitates and rotates — matching constellation shifts |
| 15  | A local Eidolon bows toward it involuntarily                     |
| 16  | The fragment vocalizes a command word in multiple voices         |

| 22  | A new tag appears on all players present                         |
| 23  | Gravity bends slightly around the object                         |
| 24  | The area becomes magnetized — drawing metal and Mana             |
| 25  | All sound is muted within a fixed radius                         |
| 26  | A false memory of activating the Engine floods your mind         |
| 31  | A glyph glows — counting down to something                       |
| 32  | The fragment scans your Eidolon and mirrors its form             |
| 33  | Spontaneous summoning occurs without a circle                    |

| 43  | You glimpse a memory of the Engine’s original destruction        |
| 44  | The fragment reconfigures — and opens a sealed vault             |
| 45  | Its awakening is sensed by a faction that now moves to claim it  |
| 46  | Time slows for anyone within line of sight                       |
| 51  | An AI speaks through the fragment — requesting intent            |
| 52  | A Chorus relay connects — and is instantly overwhelmed           |
| 53  | Local weather changes to match the Engine’s last known state     |
| 54  | Your Mana is drained into the fragment temporarily               |
| 55  | Eidolons react with fear, awe, or confusion                      |
| 56  | The fragment pulses with a signal matching your soulprint        |
| 61  | One long-dead name echoes from the core — and it’s yours         |
| 62  | A projection of the Engine’s creator appears briefly             |
| 63  | You experience a simulated trial of the Engine’s judgment        |
| 64  | A ghostly army from the First Pulse flickers into view           |
| 65  | The Engine marks its chosen — permanently and publicly           |
| 66  | It opens — and what emerges is neither machine nor divine        |


#### Eidolon Unbindings

| D66 | Unbinding Incident                                                |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 11  | An Eidolon vanishes mid-command, leaving only its Focus item      |
| 12  | The pact seal burns away without warning or consent               |
| 13  | The Eidolon turns on its summoner — but not out of hostility      |
| 14  | A chorus of voices erupts from the Eidolon before it shatters     |
| 15  | Your Eidolon asks to be unbound — and offers no reason            |
| 16  | A wild Eidolon claims the unbound form was its original state     |
| 21  | The summoner forgets ever making the pact                         |
| 22  | The Eidolon leaves behind a physical scar in the summoner’s place |
| 23  | A rival Eidolon forcibly severs the bond during battle            |
| 24  | The Eidolon declares the pact fulfilled — though you disagree     |
| 25  | A local zone contamination forces the Eidolon to flee             |
| 26  | The Focus shatters, releasing a surge of raw emotion              |
| 31  | The Eidolon begins duplicating itself — then dissolves            |
| 32  | A summoned creature takes its place without explanation           |
| 33  | An unbound Eidolon begins mimicking nearby NPCs                   |
| 34  | The Eidolon collapses into a memory core                          |
| 35  | Unbinding leaves behind a sigil only visible to enemies           |
| 36  | The Eidolon remains visible — but refuses all interaction         |
| 41  | You awaken to find the Eidolon has already unbound itself         |
| 42  | A binding circle reactivates and drags the Eidolon back in        |
| 43  | The Eidolon leaves its own message in your dreams                 |
| 44  | A past Eidolon rebinds itself without being summoned              |
| 45  | The unbound Eidolon bonds with a random item or relic             |
| 46  | A faction sends you a notice that your Eidolon has defected       |
| 51  | Your Eidolon becomes wild and starts drawing followers            |
| 52  | Unbinding warps your tags — permanently or temporarily            |
| 53  | You feel its presence everywhere — except inside the Focus        |
| 54  | The Eidolon’s last words reveal a secret about your past          |
| 55  | A pulse of energy knocks everyone unconscious but you             |
| 56  | The unbinding echoes across the Chorus network                    |
| 61  | Your Eidolon’s name is erased from all records                    |
| 62  | A stranger appears, claiming to have been your Eidolon            |
| 63  | The Eidolon fuses with a summoned rival                           |
| 64  | Its form shifts into something divine — then departs              |
| 65  | A secret clause in your pact activates — and it's binding you now |
| 66  | Your Eidolon unbinds — and the world shifts slightly with it      |

| 44  | All active relics gain a random temporary property                    |
| 45  | Spellcasting causes temporal bleed — the future leaks in              |
| 46  | Summons absorb environmental traits — and spread them                 |
| 51  | All Focus items in the area crack or scream                           |
