# Hideouts & Heartbeats

***Hideouts & Heartbeats*** is a solo tabletop RPG adventure set in the mysterious underbelly of 1980s and 1990s small-town life.

This minimalist Solo Role Playing Game is designed to capture the spirit of brave, inventive kids growing up in an era when the world still held secrets worth discovering.

## Introduction

*Hideouts & Heartbeats* follows the following design principles:

1. **Portable**: to play you will need a few common (six-sided) dice and writing materials. Anything else is optional and not essential.
2. **Rules-Light**: the game relies on a few rules and only one solving mechanic, easy to learn and eventually to memorize.
3. **Tag-based**: characters and situations are defined only by qualitative descriptors and no quantitative characteristics.

With a focus on quick resolutions, **Hideouts & Heartbeats** throws you headfirst into the heart of childhood adventure. Your character will be defined by thematic tags, like *Curious*, *Loyal*, *Reckless*, or *Tech-Savvy*.

### What is a Role Playing Game (RPG)?
A role-playing game (RPG) is a type of game in which players assume the roles of fictional characters and act out their actions and decisions within a narrative or imaginary setting. The outcome of these actions and decisions is often determined by a set of rules and game mechanics, such as dice rolls or statistical attributes of the characters. Players may also collaborate to create a shared story or narrative through their characters' actions and interactions.

### What is a Solo RPG?

In a solo RPG a single player takes on the roles of one or more characters, while also simultaneously managing some elements of the game world. These games typically involve the use of a rule system and game mechanics to determine the outcome of actions taken by the player-controlled characters. 
Unlike a gamebook (such as the Fighting Fantasy, Lone Wolf, and Tunnels & Trolls series) a solo RPG is not a form of interactive, forked narrative in which outcomes are pre-determined and limited by the author's choices.

Through the interaction of player, oracle, tools, and prompts, the character's actions will build an **emergent narrative** within whose boundaries anything can be attempted, without predetermined limits.

### Safety Tools
You will play alone, but be sure to play in an environment that is comfortable for you, without overexerting yourself, and reserve the option to stop as soon as you feel uncomfortable for any reason, physical or emotional. Don't be afraid to tackle new themes, but do so in full awareness of your boundaries.

### Minimum Requirements
To play *Hideouts & Heartbeats* you will need:
- **4 six sided dice** (also known as d6s): two pairs of different colors
- **Paper and writing tools**: at least a sheet of scrap paper and pencil, but index cards or sticky notes are a fine addition
- **Character sheet**: you may use the provided sheet at the back or a simple index card
- **Journal**: While *Hideouts & Heartbeats* can be played in the "theater of mind," keeping a journal adds to the nostalgic feel and helps track mysteries!

## The World of Hideouts & Heartbeats

In Hideouts & Heartbeats, you play as a group of brave, inventive kids growing up in the 1980s or 1990s. Your adventures unfold in:

- **Quiet American suburbs** with their sprawling developments, BMX bike trails, and secrets hidden in basement workshops
- **Coastal towns in southern Europe** where ancient stones meet modern life, and old fishermen tell stories that might be true
- **Dense Japanese neighborhoods** where neon signs buzz over narrow alleys, and tradition collides with the future
- **Rural villages** tucked between forests and ruins, where cell towers haven't reached and the old ways still hold sway

### Playable Themes

- Vanished pets and their mysterious return
- Weird lights in the sky and unexplained phenomena  
- Unsettling strangers who don't belong
- Cryptic devices that shouldn't exist yet
- Forgotten tunnels and hidden passages
- Secret codes and mysterious messages
- Unexplained disappearances in the community
- Strange sounds from abandoned places
- Technology that works differently than it should
- Adults who refuse to believe what kids have seen

### Timeline

**Early 1980s**: The cold war casts long shadows, video games are just emerging, and the internet is still a military secret. Kids rely on walkie-talkies and hand-drawn maps.

**Mid-1980s**: MTV changes everything, personal computers appear in some homes, and the first mobile phones are the size of bricks. The strange seems to be accelerating.

**Late 1980s**: The Berlin Wall falls, but new mysteries emerge. Camcorders let kids document their adventures, if they can afford the tape.

**Early 1990s**: The Soviet Union collapses, but local mysteries persist. CD players and early video game systems become the tools of a new generation of explorers.

**Mid-1990s**: The internet begins to connect the world, but in your small corner, the mysteries run deeper than any network can reach.

## Characters

In *Hideouts & Heartbeats*, you're not just one kid—you're a group of friends bound by curiosity, loyalty, and the kind of fearless determination that only children possess.

### Everything is a Character!

In *Hideouts & Heartbeats* Non-Playing Characters (NPCs), Foes, Organizations, Mysterious Entities, and even relevant objects like that weird radio in the attic are characters too!

Your Protagonist Group is described by some fixed traits:

- **Names**: Each kid in your group needs a name that fits the era and setting. Think about nicknames too—they're important.
- **Ages**: Usually between 8-16, with the sweet spot being 10-14 when kids have enough independence but not enough cynicism.
- **Group Dynamic**: How do these kids work together? Who's the leader? The thinker? The daredevil? The heart of the group?
- **Skills** (x2 per kid): Abilities that make each character useful—*"Electronics Whiz"*, *"Fearless Climber"*, *"Smooth Talker"*, *"Pattern Spotter"*.
- **Frailty** (x1 per kid): Something that could get in the way—*"Afraid of the Dark"*, *"Too Trusting"*, *"Reckless"*, *"Allergic to Everything"*.
- **Gear** (x2 per group): Special equipment your group has access to—*"Dad's Polaroid Camera"*, *"Shortwave Radio"*, *"Rope and Grappling Hook"*, *"Detailed Local Maps"*.
- **Goal**: What mystery is driving this adventure?
- **Motive**: Why does this group care about solving it?
- **Nemesis**: The adult, organization, or entity that doesn't want these kids poking around
- **Courage**: The measure of the group's ability to face fear and keep going. It applies in Conflicts and automatically recharges when they end. Courage starts and caps at 6.

These **traits** are described by **tags**, descriptive words or phrases that can identify anything in the game world. Even the **details** of the 1980s/90s environment and **conditions** (physical or emotional) of the characters are tags.

**They are qualitative representations. They are not quantitative measures.**

## Rules

*Hideouts & Heartbeats* is a minimalist Solo Role Playing Game designed to be played with a group of kid characters (the Protagonists). You'll guide them through the story that will unravel during the game, asking closed questions to an Oracle which will help you overturn your expectations about the mysteries you're investigating.

Every now and then you will be surprised with an unexpected twist!

### Keep The Mystery Moving

A game in *Hideouts & Heartbeats* is a succession of scenes. 
A scene is a unit of time in which a certain action takes place in pursuit of uncovering the next piece of the mystery.

In *Hideouts & Heartbeats* at each scene:
1. **Identify what you expect from the scene**. Based on the group's traits, goals, and motivation, determine what the kids are trying to accomplish. What might happen as a result?
2. **Test your expectations**. When you are uncertain (or overconfident) about the outcome, [ask the Oracle](#consulting-the-oracle) a closed question (answer is Yes or No), considering the tags involved to determine if there is an [Advantage or Disadvantage](#advantage-and-disadvantage).
3. **Interpret the result**. Is the Oracle's answer in line with your expectations? If not, in the context of the 1980s/90s setting and childhood adventure, how should an answer that subverts them be considered?

This sequence will come to you naturally after some practice. Use it as a guideline the first few times.

### Consulting the Oracle

When you need to test your expectations you'll ask the Oracle a closed question.

You'll need 2d6 in one color (**Chance Dice**), and 2d6 in another (**Risk Dice**).

To resolve a closed question, roll one **Chance Die** and one **Risk Die**:
- If the Chance Die is highest, the answer is **Yes**. 
- If the Risk Die is highest, the answer is **No**.
- If both are low (3 or less), add a **but...**. 
- If both are high (4 or more), add an **and...**.
- If both are equal, the answer is **Yes, but...**. Add a point to the **[Twist Counter](#twist-counter)**.

| Dice Value |    Chance Die > Risk Die   | Risk Die > Chance Die |
|:----------:|:--------------------------:|:---------------------:|
|  Both < 4  |         Yes, but...        |       No, but...      |
|  Both > 3  |         Yes, and...        |       No, and...      |
| Mismatched |             Yes            |           No          |
|            |                            |                       |
|    Equal   | Add 1 to the Twist Counter |                       |

### Advantage and Disadvantage

If circumstances or positive tags grant an advantage, add a **Chance Die** to the roll. Otherwise, when hindrances or negative tag cause a disadvantage, add a **Risk Die**. In both cases keep only the higher die of the added type when you check the roll.

Consider tags **intuitively and not quantitatively**, using the context of the situation at play. Remember: these are resourceful kids in the 1980s/90s, so creativity and friendship often provide advantages!

### Twist Counter

The Twist Counter is a measure of the rising tension in the narrative. At the beginning is set to 0. Every time a double throw (dice are equal) happens, add 1 to the Counter. If the Counter is below three, consider the answer as "**Yes, but...**". Otherwise a **Twist** happens and resets the Counter.

Roll 2d6 and consult the following Twist Table to determine what kind of twist happens. 

| D6 |      Subject       |        Action       |
|:--:|:------------------:|:-------------------:|
|  1 |    A third party   |       Appears       |
|  2 |    The group       | Alters the location |
|  3 |  A helpful adult   |    Helps the group  |
|  4 |  A physical event  |   Hinders the group |
|  5 | An emotional event |   Changes the goal  |
|  6 |    A mystery       |    Ends the scene   |

Interpret the two-word sentence in the context of the current scene. Twists will keep the plot and events going in unexpected ways, just like in the best 80s/90s adventure stories.

### Growing Up Too Fast

Sometimes the mysteries kids encounter in *Hideouts & Heartbeats* force them to confront adult realities—corruption, danger, loss, or moral ambiguity. When this happens, the group may gain **Maturity** traits that reflect their loss of innocence but also their growth in wisdom and capability.

### Conflicts

A *Conflict* is any situation in which the kids clash with opponents, or face dangerous situations that test their courage and resourcefulness.

This applies to both physical confrontations (rare but possible) and more common scenarios like:
- Convincing a suspicious adult
- Escaping from danger
- Solving a time-sensitive puzzle
- Overcoming fear to enter a scary place
- Competing against other kids who want to solve the mystery first

Conflicts can be resolved in different ways depending on preferences and context:
1. Ask a single closed question. The Oracle's answer determines the outcome of the conflict.
2. Ask a series of closed questions to resolve current single actions.
3. Use the rules of Harm & Courage below.

Note that the Twist Counter **does not apply** to Harm & Courage. Instead, it is used regularly if the Conflict is handled with closed questions.

If the conflict is resolved by applying damage to the Courage trait, roll the dice to determine whether the group succeeds in their goal or suffers setbacks due to fear, mistakes, or bad luck. The rolls are player facing only.

The damage reduces the Courage of the group. When Courage runs out, the group has lost the conflict—they might get caught, scared away, or forced to abandon their current approach.

The final outcome depends on the context. Are they grounded by their parents? Do they have to find a new way to investigate? Have they attracted unwanted adult attention?

| Answer      | Do you get what you want?                               | Harm    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Yes, and... | You get what you want, and something else.              | Gain 3  |
| Yes...      | You get what you want.                                  | Gain 2  |
| Yes, but... | You get what you want, but at a cost.                   | Gain 1  |
| No, but...  | You don't get what you want, but it's not a total loss. | Lose 1  |
| No...       | You don't get what you were after.                      | Lose 2  |
| No, and...  | You don't get what you want, and things get worse.      | Lose 3  |

### Determine the mood of the next scene

At the end of the current scene sometimes you will be clear about the direction to take, other times you may need to determine the general mood of the next one. In this case roll 1d6 and consult the following table:

|  D6 |   Next Scene   |
|:---:|:--------------:|
| 1-3 | Mystery scene  |
| 4-5 | Friendship scene |
|  6  |   Meanwhile…   |

- A **mystery scene** deepens the investigation, introducing new clues, obstacles, or dangers.
- During a **friendship scene** there is time to bond, plan, recover from setbacks, and strengthen the group's relationships.
- A **meanwhile scene** takes place somewhere else, showing what the adults, antagonists, or other forces are doing.

### Open-Ended Question or Get Inspired

To answer an Open-Ended question, roll 1d6 once on each of the Inspiration Tables (roll at least a verb and a noun, adjectives are optional).

### When the adventure ends

At the end of the adventure you may add another trait to the characters. It is better that this is related to how the story just ended and can be either a Skill, Gear, a new Frailty, or even a new Nemesis! You can also modify an existing trait to better represent enhanced expertise or growing up.

Also update the list of **NPCs**, **Locations**, and **Events** that may show up again in future adventures.
