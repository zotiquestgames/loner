# Loner: Hideouts & Heartbeats

***Loner: Hideouts & Heartbeats*** is a solo tabletop RPG adventure set in the small coastal town of Clearview during the 1980s, where kids on bikes uncover mysteries that adults either dismiss or desperately want to keep hidden.

This minimalist Solo Role Playing Game is designed to capture the thrill of friendship, wonder, and growing up in a world where the ordinary masks the extraordinary.

## Introduction

*Loner: Hideouts & Heartbeats* follows the following design principles:

1. **Portable**: to play you will need a few common (six-sided) dice and writing materials. Anything else is optional and not essential.
2. **Rules-Light**: the game relies on a few rules and only one solving mechanic, easy to learn and eventually to memorize.
3. **Tag-based**: characters and situations are defined only by qualitative descriptors and no quantitative characteristics.

With a focus on quick resolutions, **Loner: Hideouts & Heartbeats** throws you headfirst into the heart of 1980s mystery adventures. Your character will be defined by thematic tags like *Fearless Leader*, *Science Whiz*, or *Arcade Champion*.

### What is a Role Playing Game (RPG)?
A role-playing game (RPG) is a type of game in which players assume the roles of fictional characters and act out their actions and decisions within a narrative or imaginary setting. The outcome of these actions and decisions is often determined by a set of rules and game mechanics, such as dice rolls or statistical attributes of the characters. Players may also collaborate to create a shared story or narrative through their characters' actions and interactions.

### What is a Solo RPG?

In a solo RPG a single player takes on the roles of one or more characters, while also simultaneously managing some elements of the game world. These games typically involve the use of a rule system and game mechanics to determine the outcome of actions taken by the player-controlled characters. 
Unlike a gamebook (such as the Fighting Fantasy, Lone Wolf, and Tunnels & Trolls series) a solo RPG is not a form of interactive, forked narrative in which outcomes are pre-determined and limited by the author's choices.

Through the interaction of player, oracle, tools, and prompts, the character's actions will build an **emergent narrative** within whose boundaries anything can be attempted, without predetermined limits.

### Safety Tools
You will play alone, but be sure to play in an environment that is comfortable for you, without overexerting yourself, and reserve the option to stop as soon as you feel uncomfortable for any reason, physical or emotional. Don't be afraid to tackle new themes, but do so in full awareness of your boundaries.

### Minimum Requirements
To play *Loner: Hideouts & Heartbeats* you will need:
- **4 six sided dice** (also known as d6s): two pairs of different colors
- **Paper and writing tools**: at least a sheet of scrap paper and and pencil, but index cards or sticky notes are a fine addition
- **Character sheet**: you may use the provided sheet at the back or a simple index card.
- **Notebook**: *Loner: Hideouts & Heartbeats* is not a solo journaling game, you can easily play it in the "theater of mind". But you can keep track of you game if you feel the need!

## Clearview: Where Nothing Exciting Ever Happens

Clearview is your typical coastal New England town of 10,000 souls, perched between forest and sea. It's the kind of place where everyone knows everyone, secrets don't stay buried long, and the most exciting thing that happens is usually the high school football game on Friday nights. The Atlantic crashes against rocky shores to the west, while dense pine forests stretch eastward as far as the eye can see.

But lately, things have been... different. Maybe it's just your imagination, but doesn't it feel like the town is holding its breath, waiting for something to happen?

## Characters

You are a kid in 1980s Clearview - smart, curious, and maybe a little bit of an outcast. That's what makes you special. You notice things adults miss, ask questions they don't want to hear, and have the courage to investigate when something's not right.

### Everything is a Character!

In *Loner: Hideouts & Heartbeats* Non-Playing Characters (NPCs), Foes, Organizations, Monsters, and even relevant objects like bikes or walkie-talkies are characters too!

Your Protagonist is described by some fixed traits:

- **Name**: The name should be iconic and consistent with the tone and setting of 1980s small-town America.
- **Concept**: A concise description of the character's archetype, background, and role. The best are adjective-name pairings, like *"Brave Leader"* or *"Science Whiz"*.
- **Skills** (x2): Abilities that help solve mysteries and overcome challenges. *"Popular"* is not a skill, *"Arcade Champion"* is.
- **Frailty**: Something that could potentially get in the way of the character, either physically, mentally, or socially.
- **Gear** (x2): Important equipment that defines the character. Everyday items like clothes are assumed.
- **Goal**: The long-term objective driving the character forward.
- **Motive**: What emotionally drives the pursuit of the goal.
- **Nemesis**: A person or organization that hinders the protagonist. Could be the school bully, suspicious adults, or something more sinister.
- **Luck**: The measure of a character's ability to avoid ill fortune or push through fear. It applies only in Conflicts and automatically recharges when they end. Luck starts and caps at 6.

These **traits** are described by **tags**, descriptive words or phrases that can identify anything in the game world. Even the **details** of Clearview's locations and **conditions** (physical or mental) of characters are tags.

**They are qualitative representations. They are not quantitative measures.**

### Character Traits

You can use these traits to create a character on the fly, mix them, or just use them as inspiration.

## Rules

*Loner: Hideouts & Heartbeats* is a minimalist Solo Role Playing Game designed to be played with only one character (the Protagonist). You'll guide them through mystery adventures that unfold in 1980s Clearview, asking closed questions to an Oracle which will help overturn your expectations about this seemingly quiet town.

Every now and then you will be surprised with an unexpected twist!

### Keep The Action In Motion

A game in *Loner: Hideouts & Heartbeats* is a succession of scenes. 
A scene is a unit of time in which a certain action takes place in pursuit of uncovering mysteries or achieving short-term goals.

In *Loner: Hideouts & Heartbeats* at each scene:
1. **Identify what you expect from the scene**. Based on your character's traits, goal, and motivation, determine what action you want to take. What might be the reaction of the adults, other kids, or supernatural forces?
2. **Test your expectations**. When you are uncertain (or overconfident) about the reaction to your actions, [ask the Oracle](#consulting-the-oracle) a closed question (answer is Yes or No), considering the tags involved to determine if there is an [Advantage or Disadvantage](#advantage-and-disadvantage).
3. **Interpret the result**. Is the Oracle's answer in line with your expectations? If not, how should an answer that subverts them be considered in the context of 1980s small-town mysteries?

This sequence will come to you naturally after some practice. Use it as a guideline the first few times.

### Consulting the Oracle

When you need to test your expectations you'll ask the Oracle a closed question.

You'll need 2d6 in one color (**Chance Dice**), and 2d6 in another (**Risk Dice**).

To resolve a closed question, roll one **Chance Die** and one **Risk Die**:
- If the Chance Die is highest, the answer is **Yes**. 
- If the Risk Die is highest, the answer is **No**.
- If both are low (3 or less), add a **but...**. 
- If both are high (4 or more), add an **and...**.
- If both are equal, the answer is **Yes, but...**. Add a point to the **[Twist Counter](#twist-counter)**.

| Dice Value |    Chance Die > Risk Die   | Risk Die > Chance Die |
|:----------:|:--------------------------:|:---------------------:|
|  Both < 4  |         Yes, but...        |       No, but...      |
|  Both > 3  |         Yes, and...        |       No, and...      |
| Mismatched |             Yes            |           No          |
|            |                            |                       |
|    Equal   | Add 1 to the Twist Counter |                       |

### Advantage and Disadvantage

If circumstances or positive tags grant an advantage, add a **Chance Die** to the roll. Otherwise, when hindrances or negative tags cause a disadvantage, add a **Risk Die**. In both cases keep only the higher die of the added type when you check the roll.

Consider tags **intuitively and not quantitatively**, using the context of the 1980s mystery situation at play. It is important to keep the flow of play fast and not account for advantages and disadvantages numerically!

### Twist Counter

The Twist Counter is a measure of the rising tension in the narrative. At the beginning it is set to 0. Every time a double throw (dice are equal) happens, add 1 to the Counter. If the Counter is below three, consider the answer as "**Yes, but...**". Otherwise a **Twist** happens and resets the Counter.

Roll 2d6 and consult the following Twist Table to determine what kind of twist happens. 

| D6 |      Subject       |        Action       |
|:--:|:------------------:|:-------------------:|
|  1 |    A third party   |       Appears       |
|  2 |      The hero      | Alters the location |
|  3 |    An encounter    |    Helps the hero   |
|  4 |  A physical event  |   Hinders the hero  |
|  5 | An emotional event |   Changes the goal  |
|  6 |      An object     |    Ends the scene   |

Interpret the two-word sentence in the context of the current scene and Clearview's mysterious atmosphere. Twists will keep the plot and events going in unexpected ways.

### Fear and Courage

Fear is part of growing up and facing the unknown. When confronting terrifying situations in Clearview's mysteries, use these guidelines:

**Guts Points**: Start each scene with Guts equal to your current Luck value. You can spend Guts during scary encounters:
- Spend 1 Guts to reroll if you failed due to fear
- Spend 2 Guts to push through when the Oracle says you freeze up

**Freaking Out**: When facing supernatural horror or adult conspiracies, if you get a "No, but..." or "No, and..." result, you may choose to have your character Freak Out instead of suffering the normal consequence:
- **Panic**: Run away and can't return to this location this scene
- **Freeze**: Can't take action until someone helps you or danger passes  
- **Babble**: Can't communicate clearly, might reveal secrets accidentally

**Regaining Courage**: Restore Guts points by:
- Successful investigation discoveries
- Helping friends in need
- Facing fears despite being scared
- Uncovering adult deceptions

### Conflicts

A *Conflict* is any situation in which opponents clash, attacking, defending, or wearing each other down in order to win. This applies both in a practical and metaphorical sense.

In *Loner: Hideouts & Heartbeats*, conflicts might include:
- Sneaking past Officer Murphy's patrol
- Outsmarting school bullies
- Escaping from suspicious adults
- Confronting supernatural phenomena
- Racing against time to prevent disasters

Conflicts can be resolved in different ways depending on preferences and context:
1. Ask a single closed question. The Oracle's answer determines the outcome of the conflict.
2. Ask a series of closed questions to resolve current single actions.
3. Use the rules of Harm & Luck below.

Note that the Twist Counter **does not apply** to Harm & Luck. Instead, it is used regularly if the Conflict is handled with closed questions.

If the conflict is resolved by applying damage to the Luck trait, roll the dice to determine whether the protagonist causes progress toward victory or suffers setbacks due to failure or complications. The rolls are player facing only.

The damage reduces the Luck of the target, whether protagonist or obstacle. When the Luck runs out, the conflict has been resolved.

The final outcome depends on the context. Do you escape? Do you get caught? Do you solve the mystery? You may even face serious consequences if that fits the narrative.

| Answer      | Do you get what you want?                               | Harm    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Yes, and... | You get what you want, and something else.              | Cause 3 |
| Yes...      | You get what you want.                                  | Cause 2 |
| Yes, but... | You get what you want, but at a cost.                   | Cause 1 |
| No, but...  | You don't get what you want, but it's not a total loss. | Take 1  |
| No...       | You don't get what you were after.                      | Take 2  |
| No, and...  | You don't get what you want, and things get worse.      | Take 3  |

### Determine the mood of the next scene

At the end of the current scene sometimes you will be clear about the direction to take, other times you may need to determine the general mood of the next one. In this case roll 1d6 and consult the following table:

|  D6 |   Next Scene   |
|:---:|:--------------:|
| 1-3 | Dramatic scene |
| 4-5 |   Quiet Scene  |
|  6  |   Meanwhile…   |

- A **dramatic scene** does not break the tension of the previous scene but carries it further forward, introducing further obstacles or difficulties.
- During a **quiet scene** there is time to take a breath, to heal, to make plans for the next steps and to deepen friendships.
- A **meanwhile scene** takes place somewhere else in Clearview. It cuts to suspicious adults, other kids, or mysterious forces at work.

### Open-Ended Question or Get Inspired

To answer an Open-Ended question, roll 1d6 once on each of the Inspiration Tables (roll at least a verb and a noun, adjectives are optional).

### When the story ends

At the end of the adventure you may add another trait to the character. It is better that this is related to how the story just ended and can be either a Skill, Gear, a new Frailty, or even a new Nemesis! You can also modify an existing trait to better represent enhanced expertise.

Also update the list of **NPCs**, **Locations**, and **Events** that may show up again in future adventures in Clearview.
