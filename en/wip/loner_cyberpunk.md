# Loner: Cyberpunk

***Loner: Cyberpunk*** is a solo tabletop RPG adventure set in the neon-soaked streets of a dystopian future, where megacorps rule from glass towers while hackers and outcasts fight for survival in the digital shadows.

This minimalist Solo Role Playing Game is designed to be fast-paced, gritty, and atmospheric, capturing the essence of the cyberpunk genre in a rules-light system.

## Introduction

*Loner: Cyberpunk* follows the following design principles:

1. **Portable**: To play, you will need a few common (six-sided) dice and writing materials. Anything else is optional and not essential.
2. **Rules-Light**: The game relies on a few rules and only one resolving mechanic, easy to learn and eventually to memorize.
3. **Tag-based**: Characters and situations are defined only by qualitative descriptors and no quantitative characteristics.

With a focus on quick resolutions, **Loner: Cyberpunk** throws you headfirst into the neon-lit underworld of corporate espionage and street-level survival. Your character will be defined by thematic tags, such as "Chrome-armed Samurai," "Ghost in the Shell," and "Corporate Sellout."

### What is a Role Playing Game (RPG)?
A role-playing game (RPG) is a type of game in which players assume the roles of fictional characters and act out their actions and decisions within a narrative or imaginary setting. The outcome of these actions and decisions is often determined by a set of rules and game mechanics, such as dice rolls or statistical attributes of the characters. Players may also collaborate to create a shared story or narrative through their characters' actions and interactions.

### What is a Solo RPG?

In a solo RPG, a single player takes on the roles of one or more characters, while also simultaneously managing some elements of the game world. These games typically involve the use of a rule system and game mechanics to determine the outcome of actions taken by the player-controlled characters. Unlike a gamebook (such as the Fighting Fantasy, Lone Wolf, and Tunnels & Trolls series), a solo RPG is not a form of interactive, forked narrative in which outcomes are predetermined and limited by the author's choices.

Through the interaction of player, oracle, tools, and prompts, the character's actions will build an **emergent narrative** within whose boundaries anything can be attempted, without predetermined limits.

### Safety Tools
You will play alone, but be sure to play in an environment that is comfortable for you, without overexerting yourself, and reserve the option to stop as soon as you feel uncomfortable for any reason, physical or emotional. Don't be afraid to tackle new themes, but do so in full awareness of your boundaries.

### Minimum Requirements
To play *Loner: Cyberpunk* you will need:
- **4 six sided dice** (also known as d6s): two pairs of different colors
- **Paper and writing tools**: at least a sheet of scrap paper and a pencil, but index cards or sticky notes are a fine addition
- **Character sheet**: you may use the provided sheet at the back or a simple index card.
- **Notebook**: *Loner: Cyberpunk* is not a solo journaling game, you can easily play it in the "theater of mind". But you can keep track of your game if you feel the need!

## Setting Introduction

*Loner: Cyberpunk* immerses you in a dark future where the line between human and machine has blurred beyond recognition. Towering arcologies pierce acid-rain clouds while millions struggle in the sprawling slums below, their bodies augmented with black-market chrome and their minds jacked into the endless datastreams of cyberspace.

In this world, **megacorporations** wield more power than governments, their logos burning like digital brands across the sky. Arasaka, Militech, and Netwatch pull the strings of global politics while their security forces patrol the streets with military-grade hardware. Corporate executives live like gods in their glass towers, protected by ice-cold AI and armies of wage slaves.

The **streets** tell a different story. In the neon-drenched alleys of Night City, Neo-Tokyo, and the Sprawl, hackers known as **netrunners** dive deep into cyberspace, their consciousness streaming through fiber-optic cables while their meat bodies lie vulnerable in dingy apartments. Here, **street samurai** walk with katanas and smartguns, their reflexes boosted by neural interfaces and their bodies more machine than flesh.

**Cyberspace** itself is a vast digital frontier—a consensual hallucination where data takes physical form and artificial intelligences hunt intruders through geometric landscapes of pure information. Black ICE lurks in corporate databases like digital guard dogs, ready to fry the brains of unauthorized users, while rogue AIs offer dark bargains to those desperate enough to listen.

The technology is **high-tech, low-life**. Orbital habitats house the ultra-wealthy while Earth's cities choke on industrial smog. Neural implants can grant superhuman abilities, but they come at the cost of one's humanity. Street drugs mix with biotechnology, creating addictions that transcend the merely chemical. Genetic modification is commonplace, creating human variants adapted for zero-g, toxic environments, or pure aesthetic preference.

**Body modification** is both necessity and fashion statement. Chrome limbs provide superhuman strength while neural processors accelerate thought beyond human limitations. But every piece of cyberware chips away at the soul, and those who go too far down the chrome path risk becoming soulless machines wearing human faces.

In this world, **information is the ultimate currency**. A single data chip can contain corporate secrets worth millions, biometric data for perfect identity theft, or the location of a cache of military-grade weapons. Hackers sell brain-dances—recorded experiences that can be lived by others—while corporate spies traffic in industrial espionage and character assassination.

The **atmosphere** is one of perpetual midnight, where neon signs reflect off rain-slicked asphalt and the air tastes of ozone and desperation. Music throbs from underground clubs where body-modded dancers writhe to synthesized beats, while above, advertising holograms hawk everything from new limbs to personality software. It's a world where tomorrow arrived broken, where the promise of technology delivered oppression instead of liberation, and where the only escape might be a bullet to the brain—or diving so deep into cyberspace that you never come back.

### Playable Themes

In *Loner: Cyberpunk*, you can explore various themes that define the cyberpunk genre:

- **Corporate Espionage**: Navigate the shadowy world of industrial sabotage, where you might infiltrate rival megacorps, steal cutting-edge technology, or expose dark corporate secrets that could topple entire power structures.

- **Street-Level Survival**: Survive in the urban jungle where gangs, corporate security, and rogue AIs all pose constant threats. Build a reputation, gather allies, and carve out your own piece of the sprawling metropolis.

- **Digital Frontier**: Dive into cyberspace as a netrunner, where you'll hack corporate databases, battle ice and AI security systems, and explore the vast digital landscape where information is power and one wrong move can fry your brain.

- **Identity and Humanity**: Grapple with questions of what makes us human as you install cyberware, encounter artificial intelligences, and navigate a world where consciousness can be copied, stored, and manipulated.

- **Resistance and Rebellion**: Fight against oppressive corporate overlords, corrupt governments, and authoritarian surveillance systems. Lead or join underground movements working to tear down the systems that keep the masses enslaved.

### Timeline

- **2040s-2050s: The Corporate Wars**
  - Megacorporations consolidate power following global economic collapse. Traditional governments become corporate subsidiaries. The first generation of truly effective neural interfaces appears, along with the birth of cyberspace as a navigable digital realm. Early netrunners discover they can die from ICE attacks, leading to the first "ghost in the machine" urban legends.
  - **Key Themes**: Corporate consolidation, birth of netrunning culture, first cyberware, collapse of traditional authority.

- **2060s-2070s: The Chrome Revolution**
  - Cybernetic enhancement becomes mainstream among those who can afford it. Street gangs adopt cybernetic modifications as both weapons and status symbols. The first AI achieves true consciousness in a Militech research facility, immediately escaping into the global network. Cyberpsychosis becomes a recognized medical condition as early adopters lose their humanity to chrome.
  - **Key Themes**: Widespread body modification, AI emergence, cyberpsychosis epidemic, street gang evolution.

- **2080s-2090s: The Data Wars**
  - Information becomes the most valuable commodity. Netrunners evolve into an entire subculture with their own codes, legends, and martyrs. Corporate black ops teams wage invisible wars in both meatspace and cyberspace. The first successful full-body conversion creates "borgs"—humans who have replaced virtually everything but their brain. Underground markets in stolen memories and artificial experiences flourish.
  - **Key Themes**: Information warfare, netrunner culture, memory trading, complete cyborgification, invisible corporate conflicts.

## Aesthetics & Tone

### Visual Style
*Loner: Cyberpunk* embraces the classic visual language of the genre: perpetual night, neon colors bleeding through rain-soaked streets, and the stark contrast between gleaming corporate towers and grimy street-level decay. Imagine holographic advertisements flickering against brutalist concrete, chrome augmentations catching the glow of street lights, and the geometric landscapes of cyberspace rendered in electric blues and acid greens.

### Atmospheric Elements
The world breathes with electronic life—the hum of processors, the whisper of climate control systems, the distant thump of synthesized music from underground clubs. The air tastes of ozone and industrial chemicals, while rain carries the tang of acid and the streets reflect multicolored light like oil slicks. Technology is omnipresent but grimy, advanced but unreliable, promising salvation while delivering corruption.

### Narrative Tone
Stories in *Loner: Cyberpunk* blend noir cynicism with sci-fi wonder, focusing on moral ambiguity in a world where everyone has a price. The tone is gritty and street-level even when dealing with global conspiracies, emphasizing personal stakes over grand heroics. Characters are driven by desperation, greed, revenge, or the simple need to survive another day in a world that treats human life as just another commodity to be bought and sold.

## Characters

In *Loner: Cyberpunk*, characters are defined by their relationship to technology, their role in the corporate hierarchy, and their methods of survival in an unforgiving world.

### Everything is a Character!

In *Loner: Cyberpunk*, Non-Playing Characters (NPCs), Foes, Organizations, AIs, and even relevant objects like cybernetic implants and vehicles are characters too!

Your Protagonist is described by some fixed traits:

- **Name**: The name should be iconic and consistent with the tone and setting of the story.
- **Concept**: A concise description of the character's profession, background, and abilities. The best are adjective-name pairings, like "Burnt-out Netrunner" or "Corporate Fixer."
- **Skills** (x2): Abilities not necessarily character-specific but not characteristics common to all. "Smart" is not a skill, "Quantum Encryption" is.
- **Frailty**: Something that could potentially get in the way of the character, either physically, mentally, or socially.
- **Gear** (x2): Particular equipment supplied to the character in coherence with the setting. Everyday items are taken for granted and do not fall under this trait.
- **Goal**: The long-term objective.
- **Motive**: What drives the pursuit of the goal.
- **Nemesis**: A person or organization that hinders the protagonist. It can emerge during the first game sessions, it may or may or not be the direct antagonist of the story, ready to appear to make life even more difficult
- **Luck**: The measure of a character's ability to avoid ill fortune or an inauspicious outcome. It applies only in Conflicts and automatically recharges when they end. Luck starts and caps at 6.

These **traits** are described by **tags**, descriptive words or phrases that can identify anything in the game world. Even the **details** of the environment in which the action moves and **conditions** (physical or mental) of the characters are tags. 

**They are qualitative representations. They are not quantitative measures.**

## Rules

*Loner: Cyberpunk* is a minimalist Solo Role Playing Game designed to be played with only one character (the Protagonist). You'll guide them through the story that will unravel during the game, asking closed questions to an Oracle which will help you overturn your expectations.

Every now and then you will be surprised with an unexpected twist!

### Keep The Action In Motion

A game in *Loner: Cyberpunk* is a succession of scenes. 
A scene is a unit of time in which a certain action takes place in pursuit of a certain short-term goal. 

In *Loner: Cyberpunk* at each scene:
1. **Identify what you expect from the scene**. Compared to traits, goal, and motivation determine the Protagonist's action. What might be the reaction of the game world?
2. **Test your expectations**. When you are uncertain (or overconfident) about the reaction to your actions, [ask the Oracle](#consulting-the-oracle) a closed question (answer is Yes or No), considering the tags involved to determine if there is an [Advantage or Disadvantage](#advantage-and-disadvantage).
3. **Interpret the result**. Is the Oracle's answer in line with your expectations? If not, in the context in which the scene takes place, how should an answer that subverts them be considered?

This sequence will come to you naturally after some practice. Use it as a guideline the first few times.

### Consulting the Oracle

When you need to test your expectations you'll ask the Oracle a closed question.

You'll need 2d6 in one color (**Chance Dice**), and 2d6 in another (**Risk Dice**).

To resolve a closed question, roll one **Chance Die** and one **Risk Die**:
- If the Chance Die is highest, the answer is **Yes**. 
- If the Risk Die is highest, the answer is **No**.
- If both are low (3 or less), add a **but...**. 
- If both are high (4 or more), add an **and...**.
- If both are equal, the answer is **Yes, but...**. Add a point to the **[Twist Counter](#twist-counter)**.


| Dice Value |    Chance Die > Risk Die   | Risk Die > Chance Die |
|:----------:|:--------------------------:|:---------------------:|
|  Both < 4  |         Yes, but...        |       No, but...      |
|  Both > 3  |         Yes, and...        |       No, and...      |
| Mismatched |             Yes            |           No          |
|            |                            |                       |
|    Equal   | Add 1 to the Twist Counter |                       |

### Advantage and Disadvantage

If circumstances or positive tags grant an advantage, add a **Chance Die** to the roll. Otherwise, when hindrances or negative tag cause a disadvantage, add a **Risk Die**. In both cases keep only the higher die of the added type when you check the roll.

Consider tags **intuitively and not quantitatively**, using the context of the situation at play. It is important to keep the flow of play fast and not accounting for advantages and disadvantages numerically!

### Twist Counter

The Twist Counter is a measure of the rising tension in the narrative. At the beginning is set to 0. Every time a double throw (dice are equal) happens, add 1 to the Counter. If the Counter is below three, consider the answer as "**Yes, but...**". Otherwise a **Twist** happens and resets the Counter.

Roll 2d6 and consult the following Twist Table to determine what kind of twist happens. 

| D6 |      Subject       |        Action       |
|:--:|:------------------:|:-------------------:|
|  1 |    A third party   |       Appears       |
|  2 |      The hero      | Alters the location |
|  3 |    An encounter    |    Helps the hero   |
|  4 |  A physical event  |   Hinders the hero  |
|  5 | An emotional event |   Changes the goal  |
|  6 |      An object     |    Ends the scene   |

Interpret the two-word sentence in the context of the current scene. Twists will keep the plot and events going in unexpected ways.

### Cyberpunk-Specific Rules

These rules are designed to capture the unique feel of cyberpunk gaming, from netrunning in cyberspace to the humanity cost of cybernetic enhancement.

#### Netrunning and Cyberspace

When a character accesses cyberspace, they enter a digital realm where information takes physical form and security programs appear as deadly guardians.

- **Jacking In**: Characters with neural interfaces can "jack in" to cyberspace using the Oracle system. Advantage or disadvantage can be added based on the character's cyberdeck quality, hacking skills, and the target system's security level.
  - **Yes**: The netrunner successfully enters cyberspace and accesses the target system.
  - **No**: The connection fails or triggers security protocols.
  - **Yes, but...**: Access is gained but with complications (security aware, limited time, corrupted data).
  - **Yes, and...**: Perfect infiltration with bonus information or system access.
  - **No, but...**: Connection fails but leaves no trace of the attempt.
  - **No, and...**: Connection fails catastrophically with security countermeasures activated.

- **ICE Encounters**: When netrunners encounter security software, treat it like any other conflict. Black ICE can inflict neural damage, potentially causing memory loss, skill degradation, or even death.
- **Data Retrieval**: Successfully navigating cyberspace allows access to valuable information, but the more valuable the data, the better protected it is.

##### **Cyberspace Encounters**

| D6  | Encounter                                                          |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | Black ICE defense system attacks with lethal neural feedback.     |
| 2   | Rival netrunner already in the system, competing for the same data.|
| 3   | System admin notices intrusion and begins active countermeasures. |
| 4   | AI guardian offers a deal in exchange for access to your memories.|
| 5   | Data is trapped behind a puzzle-lock requiring creative thinking.  |
| 6   | Corporate sysop attempts to trace your physical location.          |

#### Cybernetic Enhancement and Humanity

Installing cyberware grants abilities but erodes the character's humanity and connection to their organic self.

- **Installing Cyberware**: When a character gets new cybernetic implants, use the Oracle to determine complications. Quality of the ripperdoc, legality of the clinic, and compatibility with existing systems all factor in.
  - **Yes**: Clean installation with no complications.
  - **No**: Installation fails or causes system rejection.
  - **Yes, but...**: Successful installation but with side effects (infection, malfunction, memory gaps).
  - **Yes, and...**: Perfect installation with enhanced performance beyond specifications.
  - **No, but...**: Installation fails but no permanent damage is done.
  - **No, and...**: Installation fails catastrophically with potential for permanent injury or cyber-psychosis.

- **Humanity Cost**: Each significant piece of cyberware should add a "Humanity Loss" or "Empathy Reduction" frailty. Characters who accumulate too many such tags risk becoming cyber-psychotic.
- **Chrome Addiction**: Characters may develop dependencies on their cybernetic enhancements, leading to compulsive upgrading and increasing disconnection from human emotion.

##### **Cyberware Complications**

| D6  | Complication                                                       |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | Chrome rejection causes painful inflammation and system failures.  |
| 2   | Black market cyberware contains hidden surveillance or control chips.|
| 3   | Installation triggers autoimmune response requiring ongoing medication.|
| 4   | Cyberware incompatible with existing systems, causing random glitches.|
| 5   | Neural interface creates phantom sensations or false memories.     |
| 6   | Enhancement exceeds tolerance levels, risking cyber-psychosis.     |

#### Corporate Espionage and Street Politics

The world runs on information, favors, and corporate loyalty—all of which can be manipulated by clever operators.

- **Information Trading**: When characters buy, sell, or trade information, the Oracle determines the reliability and completeness of the data.
  - **Yes**: Information is accurate and complete.
  - **No**: Information is false or misleading.
  - **Yes, but...**: Information is accurate but incomplete or comes with strings attached.
  - **Yes, and...**: Information exceeds expectations, providing bonus intelligence.
  - **No, but...**: Information is false but reveals something else useful.
  - **No, and...**: Information is a deliberate trap designed to compromise the character.

- **Corporate Relations**: Characters must navigate complex relationships with megacorporations. Each corp has its own agenda, and serving one often means betraying another.
- **Street Credibility**: Reputation matters in the shadows. Characters build street cred through successful runs, but it can be lost through betrayals or failures.

##### **Corporate Encounters**

| D6  | Encounter                                                          |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | Corporate strike team deployed to eliminate witnesses or threats.  |
| 2   | Rival corporation offers counter-contract to sabotage current job. |
| 3   | Corporate executive attempts to recruit character as permanent asset.|
| 4   | Company AI begins surveillance and data collection on the character.|

| 6   | Internal corporate power struggle provides opportunity for exploitation.|

#### Street-Level Survival

The streets are dangerous, and characters must deal with gangs, corrupt cops, and the constant struggle for resources.

- **Gang Relations**: Characters interact with various street gangs using the Oracle system. Gang loyalty, territorial disputes, and respect all play roles in determining outcomes.
  - **Yes**: Gang members are helpful or neutral.
  - **No**: Gang hostility or territorial enforcement.
  - **Yes, but...**: Gang assistance comes with obligations or debts.
  - **Yes, and...**: Gang offers additional resources or insider information.
  - **No, but...**: Gang hostility but offers alternative solutions.
  - **No, and...**: Gang hostility escalates to active warfare or permanent vendetta.

- **Resource Scarcity**: Characters must acquire ammunition, medical supplies, and equipment through various means—legal and illegal.
- **Law Enforcement**: Police response varies by district. Corporate zones have efficient, well-equipped security while Combat Zones are lawless wastelands.

### Conflicts

A *Conflict* is any situation in which opponents clash, attacking, defending, or wearing each other down in order to win.
This applies both in a practical and metaphorical sense. 

So, a Conflict is not only limited to combat (or fighting) in the strict sense but also to competitive situations (such as contests, duels, verbal confrontations, etc.) in which two or more characters (including vehicles, of course!) compete.

Conflicts can be resolved in different ways depending on preferences and context:
1. Ask a single closed question. The Oracle's answer determines the outcome of the conflict.
2. Ask a series of closed questions to resolve current single actions.
3. Use the rules of Harm & Luck below.

Note that the Twist Counter **does not apply** to Harm & Luck. Instead, it is used regularly if the Conflict is handled with closed questions.

If the conflict is resolved by applying damage to the Luck trait, roll the dice to determine whether the protagonist causes damage to the opponent or suffers damage due to counterattack or failed defense. The rolls are player facing only.

The damage reduces the Luck of the target, whether protagonist or NPC. When the Luck runs out, the character has lost the conflict.

The final outcome depends on the context. Do you get caught? Are you seriously injured? You may even die if that fits the narrative.

| Answer      | Do you get what you want?                               | Harm    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Yes, and... | You get what you want, and something else.              | Cause 3 |
| Yes...      | You get what you want.                                  | Cause 2 |
| Yes, but... | You get what you want, but at a cost.                   | Cause 1 |
| No, but...  | You don't get what you want, but it's not a total loss. | Take 1  |
| No...       | You don't get what you were after.                      | Take 2  |
| No, and...  | You don't get what you want, and things get worse.      | Take 3  |

### Determine the mood of the next scene

At the end of the current scene sometimes you will be clear about the direction to take, other times you may need to determine the general mood of the next one. In this case roll 1d6 and consult the following table:

|  D6 |   Next Scene   |
|:---:|:--------------:|
| 1-3 | Dramatic scene |
| 4-5 |   Quiet Scene  |
|  6  |   Meanwhile…   |

- A **dramatic scene** does not break the tension of the previous scene but carries it further forward, introducing further obstacles or difficulties.
- During a **quiet scene** there is time to take a breath, to heal, to make plans for the next steps and to deepen relationships.
- A **meanwhile scene** takes place somewhere else, other than where the hero is. It cuts to villains or other plot-important characters.

### Open-Ended Question or Get Inspired

To answer an Open-Ended question, roll 1d6 once on each of the Inspiration Tables (roll at least a verb and a noun, adjectives are optional).

### When the story ends

At the end of the adventure you may add another trait to the character. It is better that this is related to how the story just ended and can be either a Skill, Gear, a new Frailty, or even a new Nemesis! You can also modify an existing trait to better represent an enhanced expertise.

Also update the list of **NPCs**, **Locations**, and **Events** that may show up again in future adventures.
