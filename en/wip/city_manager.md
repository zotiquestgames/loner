# City Manager

***City Manager*** is a solo tabletop RPG adventure set in the challenging world of city management and urban development.

This minimalist Solo Role Playing Game is designed to simulate the complexities of governing a growing settlement, from a small village to a sprawling metropolis.

## Introduction

*City Manager* follows the following design principles:

1. **Portable**: to play you will need a few common (six-sided) dice and writing materials. Anything else is optional and not essential.
2. **Rules-Light**: the game relies on a few rules and only one solving mechanic, easy to learn and eventually to memorize.
3. **Tag-based**: your city, districts, and situations are defined only by qualitative descriptors and no quantitative characteristics.

With a focus on quick resolutions, **City Manager** throws you headfirst into the heart of municipal governance. Your city will be defined by thematic tags, like *"Industrial Hub"*, *"Tourist Destination"*, or *"Crime-Ridden"*.

### What is a Role Playing Game (RPG)?
A role-playing game (RPG) is a type of game in which players assume the roles of fictional characters and act out their actions and decisions within a narrative or imaginary setting. The outcome of these actions and decisions is often determined by a set of rules and game mechanics, such as dice rolls or statistical attributes of the characters. Players may also collaborate to create a shared story or narrative through their characters' actions and interactions.

### What is a Solo RPG?

In a solo RPG a single player takes on the roles of one or more characters, while also simultaneously managing some elements of the game world. These games typically involve the use of a rule system and game mechanics to determine the outcome of actions taken by the player-controlled characters. 

Through the interaction of player, oracle, tools, and prompts, your decisions will build an **emergent narrative** of urban growth, political intrigue, and civic challenges.

### Safety Tools
You will play alone, but be sure to play in an environment that is comfortable for you, without overexerting yourself, and reserve the option to stop as soon as you feel uncomfortable for any reason, physical or emotional. Don't be afraid to tackle challenging urban themes, but do so in full awareness of your boundaries.

### Minimum Requirements
To play *City Manager* you will need:
- **4 six sided dice** (also known as d6s): two pairs of different colors
- **Paper and writing tools**: at least a sheet of scrap paper and pencil, but index cards or sticky notes are a fine addition
- **City sheet**: you may use the provided sheet at the back or a simple index card
- **Notebook**: *City Manager* is not a solo journaling game, you can easily play it in the "theater of mind". But tracking your city's growth makes the experience richer!

## The Urban Setting

City Manager places you in the role of a city administrator, mayor, or planning commissioner responsible for guiding a settlement's development. Your decisions will shape not just the physical infrastructure, but the social, economic, and political landscape of your growing community.

### Playable Themes

- **Economic Development**: Balancing industry, commerce, and residential needs
- **Social Dynamics**: Managing diverse populations and their competing interests  
- **Environmental Challenges**: Dealing with pollution, natural disasters, and resource scarcity
- **Political Intrigue**: Navigating council politics, corruption, and public opinion
- **Urban Planning**: Designing efficient transportation, utilities, and public spaces
- **Crisis Management**: Handling emergencies, protests, and sudden changes

### Timeline Scale

- **Turn**: Represents 1-3 months of city time
- **Season**: 4 turns, representing major budget cycles
- **Year**: Represents electoral cycles and long-term planning horizons
- **Decade**: For generational changes and major infrastructure projects

## Your City

Your city is the main "character" in City Manager, described by evolving traits that capture its essence, strengths, and challenges.

### Everything is a District!

In *City Manager*, Districts, Neighborhoods, Organizations, Infrastructure Projects, and even major Buildings can be treated as characters with their own traits!

Your City is described by some core traits:

- **Name**: The city's name should reflect its character, history, or geography.
- **Concept**: A concise description of the city's primary identity and character. Examples: *"Industrial River Town"*, *"Mountain Resort Community"*, *"Agricultural Trading Hub"*.
- **Strengths** (x2): What your city does well - economic advantages, natural resources, or cultural assets.
- **Challenge**: The primary obstacle or problem your city faces - could be economic, social, environmental, or political.
- **Infrastructure** (x2): Key civic assets like transportation systems, utilities, or major facilities.
- **Vision**: Your long-term goal for the city's development.
- **Mandate**: What drives your decision-making - efficiency, growth, sustainability, equality, etc.
- **Opposition**: A faction, problem, or rival that consistently challenges your administration.
- **Prosperity**: The measure of your city's overall health and your political capital. Starts and caps at 6, automatically recharges after major conflicts or crises are resolved.

These **traits** are described by **tags**, descriptive words or phrases that can identify anything in your city. Even **conditions** affecting districts or **situations** facing your administration are tags.

**They are qualitative representations. They are not quantitative measures.**

### City Development Traits

You can use these traits to create a city on the fly, mix them, or just use them as inspiration.

## Rules

*City Manager* is a minimalist Solo Role Playing Game designed to simulate city management through emergent storytelling. You'll guide your city through challenges, making decisions that shape its development while dealing with unexpected crises and opportunities.

### Keep The Development Moving

A game in *City Manager* is a succession of scenarios. 
A scenario is a situation requiring administrative attention - a policy decision, crisis response, development project, or political challenge.

In *City Manager* for each scenario:
1. **Identify the situation and your intended response**. Based on your city's traits, vision, and mandate, determine what action you want to take. What might be the consequences or public reaction?
2. **Test your expectations**. When uncertain about outcomes, [ask the Oracle](#consulting-the-oracle) a closed question (answer is Yes or No), considering relevant city tags to determine if there is an [Advantage or Disadvantage](#advantage-and-disadvantage).
3. **Interpret the result**. Is the Oracle's answer what you expected? If not, how does this unexpected outcome change the situation or create new challenges for your administration?

### Consulting the Oracle

When you need to test your expectations about policy outcomes, public reactions, or development success, you'll ask the Oracle a closed question.

You'll need 2d6 in one color (**Chance Dice**), and 2d6 in another (**Risk Dice**).

To resolve a closed question, roll one **Chance Die** and one **Risk Die**:
- If the Chance Die is highest, the answer is **Yes**. 
- If the Risk Die is highest, the answer is **No**.
- If both are low (3 or less), add a **but...**. 
- If both are high (4 or more), add an **and...**.
- If both are equal, the answer is **Yes, but...**. Add a point to the **[Crisis Counter](#crisis-counter)**.

| Dice Value |    Chance Die > Risk Die   | Risk Die > Chance Die |
|:----------:|:--------------------------:|:---------------------:|
|  Both < 4  |         Yes, but...        |       No, but...      |
|  Both > 3  |         Yes, and...        |       No, and...      |
| Mismatched |             Yes            |           No          |
|            |                            |                       |
|    Equal   | Add 1 to the Crisis Counter |                      |

### Advantage and Disadvantage

If circumstances or positive city tags support your action, add a **Chance Die** to the roll. When problems or negative tags work against you, add a **Risk Die**. In both cases keep only the higher die of the added type when checking the result.

Consider tags **intuitively and contextually**, using the current situation. Keep the flow of administration fast and don't get bogged down in numerical calculations!

### Crisis Counter

The Crisis Counter measures rising tension and instability in your city. It starts at 0. Every time you roll doubles, add 1 to the Counter. If the Counter is below three, treat the result as "**Yes, but...**". When it reaches three or more, a **Crisis** occurs and the Counter resets.

Roll 2d6 and consult the Crisis Table to determine what emergency demands your attention.

| D6 |        Issue        |       Scope        |
|:--:|:-------------------:|:------------------:|
|  1 |  Economic Problem   |   Affects Budget   |
|  2 |   Social Unrest     | Threatens Stability|
|  3 |  Infrastructure     |   Needs Attention  |
|  4 | Environmental Issue |  Requires Response |
|  5 |  Political Challenge|   Tests Leadership |
|  6 |   External Threat   |  Changes Priorities|

Interpret the crisis in context of your current city situation. Crises create urgency and may force you to abandon or modify current projects.

### Municipal Governance

Urban planning involves balancing multiple competing priorities and stakeholder interests. Your city has various systems that need attention:

- **Economic Development**: Managing growth, attracting business, controlling costs
- **Social Services**: Education, healthcare, public safety, welfare
- **Infrastructure**: Transportation, utilities, communications, maintenance  
- **Environment**: Pollution control, green space, sustainability, disaster prep
- **Politics**: Public opinion, council relations, elections, lobbying

Each major decision you make should consider multiple systems. Use the Oracle to test how policies affect different aspects of city life.

### Conflicts and Negotiations

Municipal conflicts arise between competing interests - developers vs. environmentalists, residents vs. businesses, different neighborhoods, etc.

Conflicts can be resolved through:
1. **Single Oracle Question**: Simple policy decisions with clear outcomes
2. **Series of Questions**: Complex negotiations with multiple stages  
3. **Prosperity & Pressure**: Formal system for major political battles

When using Prosperity & Pressure, roll to see if your administration gains or loses political capital. Damage reduces Prosperity. When Prosperity reaches zero, you face a vote of no confidence, recall election, or similar political crisis.

| Answer      | Policy Outcome                                    | Political Cost |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Yes, and... | Policy succeeds beyond expectations               | Gain 1 Prosperity |
| Yes...      | Policy succeeds as planned                        | No change      |
| Yes, but... | Policy succeeds but creates new problems          | No change      |
| No, but...  | Policy fails but you minimize damage              | Lose 1 Prosperity |
| No...       | Policy fails as expected                          | Lose 2 Prosperity |
| No, and...  | Policy fails spectacularly, creating scandal     | Lose 3 Prosperity |

### Determine the Focus of the Next Scenario

At the end of each scenario, you may know exactly what needs attention next. Other times, roll 1d6 to determine what type of situation demands your focus:

|  D6 |      Next Focus      |
|:---:|:--------------------:|
| 1-2 | Development Project  |
| 3-4 | Administrative Issue |
| 5-6 | External Situation   |

- A **development project** involves expanding or improving city infrastructure, services, or facilities
- An **administrative issue** deals with internal governance, budget, personnel, or policy implementation  
- An **external situation** involves relationships with other cities, regional government, private sector, or unexpected events

### Open-Ended Questions and Inspiration

To answer open-ended questions about what happens, who's involved, or how situations develop, roll 1d6 on the Inspiration Tables (at minimum a verb and noun, adjective optional).

### City Evolution

As your city develops, you may add new traits or modify existing ones. Major successful projects might add positive infrastructure or strength tags. Resolved crises might remove challenge tags or create new ones. Failed policies might add frailty tags or modify your city's concept.

Update your list of **Districts**, **Organizations**, and **Ongoing Situations** that will influence future scenarios.

## Urban Development

City Manager focuses on the strategic and political aspects of city management rather than detailed resource tracking. Development happens through policy decisions and their consequences.

### Planning Projects

* **Define Your Objective:** Identify what you want to build, improve, or change - a new district, transportation system, public facility, or policy initiative.
* **Assess Feasibility:** Consider your city's current traits, available resources, and potential opposition.
* **Build Support:** Determine what political coalition you need and what obstacles must be overcome.

### Implementation

#### A. Project Development

* **Approval Process:** Use Oracle questions to determine if proposals gain necessary support from city council, public hearings, or regulatory approval.
* **Budget Considerations:** Test whether funding is adequate, requires borrowing, or needs to be scaled back.  
* **Timeline Challenges:** Roll for unexpected delays, cost overruns, or implementation problems.

#### B. Policy Implementation  

* **Public Reception:** How do citizens, businesses, and interest groups react to new policies?
* **Administrative Capacity:** Does your city government have the expertise and resources to implement effectively?
* **Unintended Consequences:** What side effects or complications emerge during rollout?

#### Measuring Success

Upon project completion, assess the results using Oracle questions. Did the development achieve its intended goals? What new tags does it add to your city? How does it change the political landscape for future decisions?

## City Systems

## Sample Scenarios

### Starting Your First City

**Riverside** is a small town of about 15,000 people situated along a major river. You've just been elected mayor on a platform of managed growth and environmental responsibility.

**City Traits:**
- **Name**: Riverside
- **Concept**: Historic River Town
- **Strengths**: Natural Beauty, Strong Community
- **Challenge**: Aging Infrastructure  
- **Infrastructure**: Old Bridge System, Victorian Downtown
- **Vision**: Sustainable Growth Hub
- **Mandate**: Balance Development with Preservation
- **Opposition**: Old Guard Traditionalists
- **Prosperity**: 6

**Opening Scenario**: A regional tech company has approached the city about relocating their headquarters to Riverside, bringing 200 high-paying jobs. However, they want significant tax incentives and are eyeing the historic waterfront district for their campus. The proposal has split the community between economic opportunity and historic preservation.

**Questions to Consider:**
- Do you support the tax incentive package? (Oracle roll considering Economic vs. Environmental priorities)
- Will the community accept waterfront development? (Oracle roll with advantage from Jobs, disadvantage from Historic Preservation)
- Can you find a compromise location that satisfies both sides?

### Mid-Game Crisis Example

Your city of **New Haven** (Population 75,000) has been growing rapidly, adding the *"Tech Hub"* and *"Tourist Destination"* tags over the past few game years. However, this success has created new problems.

**Crisis Trigger**: After rolling doubles on a housing policy question, your Crisis Counter hits 3. Rolling on the Crisis Table: Social Unrest + Threatens Stability.

**The Crisis**: Longtime residents, priced out by tech worker influx, have organized massive protests. They're demanding rent control, affordable housing mandates, and restrictions on luxury development. Counter-protesters (business community and new residents) argue these measures will stall economic growth. The city council is paralyzed, and local media is calling it a "class war."

**Your Options:**
1. Support rent control measures (High political cost with business community)
2. Propose compromise affordable housing requirements (Complex negotiation)  
3. Focus on increasing housing supply through zoning reform (Long-term solution)
4. Mediate between groups to find middle ground (Requires multiple Oracle rolls)

Each choice leads to different Oracle questions and potential outcomes, with success or failure adding new tags to your city.

### End-Game Transformation

After years of play, your small farming community of **Prairie View** has evolved into **Prairie View Metropolitan Area** with over 300,000 residents across multiple municipalities. 

**Current Tags**: *"Regional Hub"*, *"University Town"*, *"Agricultural Processing Center"*, *"Interstate Junction"*, *"Diverse Economy"*, *"Traffic Problems"*, *"Housing Shortage"*

**Major Decision**: The state has offered to designate Prairie View as the location for a new high-speed rail hub connecting three major metropolitan areas. This would bring enormous economic benefits but require extensive land acquisition, including some historic family farms that founded the community.

This represents the kind of complex, multi-faceted decision that tests everything you've built, involving multiple stakeholder groups, competing values, and long-term consequences for your city's identity.

## District Management

As your city grows, you may want to track major districts as separate entities with their own traits. This allows for more granular decision-making about different areas of the city.

### District Traits
- **Name**: Geographic or functional identifier
- **Character**: What defines this area's identity
- **Primary Use**: Residential, Commercial, Industrial, Mixed-Use, etc.
- **Condition**: Current state and maintenance level
- **Notable Feature**: Something that makes this district special
- **Challenge**: Main problem or development pressure
- **Stakeholders**: Who has the most influence here

### Sample Districts

#### Historic Downtown
- **Character**: Victorian-Era Commercial Core
- **Primary Use**: Mixed-Use (Retail, Office, Residential)
- **Condition**: Well-Maintained but Aging
- **Notable Feature**: Restored Opera House
- **Challenge**: Parking Shortage
- **Stakeholders**: Historic Preservation Society, Local Business Association

#### Suburban Meadows
- **Character**: Post-War Residential Subdivision  
- **Primary Use**: Single-Family Housing
- **Condition**: Mature, Some Deferred Maintenance
- **Notable Feature**: Tree-Lined Streets
- **Challenge**: Aging Population, Declining Tax Base
- **Stakeholders**: Neighborhood Association, Senior Residents

#### Industrial Corridor
- **Character**: Manufacturing and Logistics Zone
- **Primary Use**: Heavy Industrial
- **Condition**: Mix of Modern and Obsolete Facilities
- **Notable Feature**: Rail Access
- **Challenge**: Environmental Contamination
- **Stakeholders**: Labor Union, Environmental Groups, Manufacturing Association

## Advanced Political Mechanics

### Election Cycles

Every 4-8 scenarios (representing 1-2 years), hold elections that can change your city's political landscape:

**Mayoral Elections**: Test your popularity with Oracle rolls modified by recent policy successes/failures
**Council Elections**: May change the political composition and your ability to pass initiatives  
**Ballot Measures**: Citizens may propose policy changes through direct democracy

### Coalition Building

For major initiatives, identify which stakeholder groups you need to support your proposal:

**Business Community**: Tax policy, development projects, economic incentives
**Environmental Groups**: Green initiatives, growth management, sustainability  
**Neighborhood Associations**: Zoning changes, traffic calming, local services
**Labor Unions**: Public works projects, municipal employment, workplace safety
**Social Justice Coalition**: Affordable housing, equity programs, community development

Use Oracle questions to test whether your outreach successfully gains each group's support.

### Media and Public Opinion

Public perception affects your political capital and ability to implement policies:

**Positive Coverage**: Gain advantage on future Oracle rolls for related policies
**Negative Coverage**: Face disadvantage when dealing with public trust issues
**Scandal**: Automatic Prosperity loss and potential crisis triggers
**Awards/Recognition**: Boost city reputation and attract new opportunities

## Long-Term City Evolution

### Generational Change

Every 20-30 scenarios, consider how your city has evolved over a generation:

**Population Growth**: Small towns become cities, cities become metropolitan areas
**Economic Transformation**: Agricultural to industrial to service to knowledge economy
**Demographic Shifts**: New immigrant communities, aging population, student influx
**Cultural Evolution**: Historic preservation vs. modernization tensions
**Infrastructure Lifecycle**: Systems built early in the game need replacement
**Environmental Consequences**: Long-term effects of early development decisions

### Legacy Systems

Decisions made early in city development create path dependencies:

**Transportation Networks**: Highway-focused vs. transit-oriented development
**Zoning Patterns**: Single-use vs. mixed-use districts  
**Economic Base**: Diversified vs. dependent on single industry
**Political Culture**: Collaborative vs. adversarial governance styles
**Environmental Record**: Sustainable practices vs. cleanup costs

### Metropolitan Challenges

As cities grow beyond their boundaries:

**Regional Coordination**: Working with neighboring municipalities
**Suburban Sprawl**: Managing growth patterns and annexation
**Infrastructure Systems**: Regional transportation, utilities, waste management
**Economic Competition**: Attracting business vs. beggar-thy-neighbor policies  
**Environmental Issues**: Air quality, watershed protection, regional planning
