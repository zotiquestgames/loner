# Dino Breach!

***Dino Breach!*** is a solo tabletop RPG adventure set in a world where genetic engineering has brought dinosaurs back to life, only for everything to go catastrophically wrong.

This minimalist Solo Role Playing Game is designed to capture the tension, horror, and wonder of prehistoric predators unleashed in the modern world through corporate hubris and scientific overreach.

## Introduction

*Dino Breach!* follows the following design principles:

1. **Portable**: to play you will need a few common (six-sided) dice and writing materials. Anything else is optional and not essential.
2. **Rules-Light**: the game relies on a few rules and only one solving mechanic, easy to learn and eventually to memorize.
3. **Tag-based**: characters and situations are defined only by qualitative descriptors and no quantitative characteristics.

With a focus on quick resolutions, **Dino Breach!** throws you headfirst into the heart of the action. Your character will be defined by thematic tags, like *"Raptor Whisperer"*, *"Corporate Whistleblower"*, or *"Weapons Expert"*.

### What is a Role Playing Game (RPG)?
A role-playing game (RPG) is a type of game in which players assume the roles of fictional characters and act out their actions and decisions within a narrative or imaginary setting. The outcome of these actions and decisions is often determined by a set of rules and game mechanics, such as dice rolls or statistical attributes of the characters. Players may also collaborate to create a shared story or narrative through their characters' actions and interactions.

### What is a Solo RPG?

In a solo RPG a single player takes on the roles of one or more characters, while also simultaneously managing some elements of the game world. These games typically involve the use of a rule system and game mechanics to determine the outcome of actions taken by the player-controlled characters. 
Unlike a gamebook (such as the Fighting Fantasy, Lone Wolf, and Tunnels & Trolls series) a solo RPG is not a form of interactive, forked narrative in which outcomes are pre-determined and limited by the author's choices.

Through the interaction of player, oracle, tools, and prompts, the character's actions will build an **emergent narrative** within whose boundaries anything can be attempted, without predetermined limits.

### Safety Tools
You will play alone, but be sure to play in an environment that is comfortable for you, without overexerting yourself, and reserve the option to stop as soon as you feel uncomfortable for any reason, physical or emotional. Don't be afraid to tackle new themes, but do so in full awareness of your boundaries.

### Minimum Requirements
To play *Dino Breach!* you will need:
- **4 six sided dice** (also known as d6s): two pairs of different colors
- **Paper and writing tools**: at least a sheet of scrap paper and and pencil, but index cards or sticky notes are a fine addition
- **Character sheet**: you may use the provided sheet at the back or a simple index card.
- **Notebook**: *Dino Breach!* is not a solo journaling game, you can easily play it in the "theater of mind". But you can keep track of you game if you feel the need!

## The World of Dino Breach

The year is 2029. Breakthrough advances in genetic engineering have allowed corporations like Biosyn, InGen, and Helios Corporation to successfully clone and breed dinosaurs. What began as theme park attractions and military applications has spiraled into containment breaches, corporate espionage, and ecological disasters.

- **Corporate Facilities**: Sprawling research complexes, theme parks, and breeding facilities scattered across remote islands and isolated mainland locations
- **Containment Zones**: Areas where dinosaur populations have established themselves after various "incidents"
- **Underground Markets**: Black market trade in dinosaur DNA, eggs, and live specimens
- **Military Applications**: Weaponized dinosaurs and anti-dino warfare technology
- **Activist Networks**: Environmental and animal rights groups working to expose or protect the creatures
- **Government Oversight**: International task forces struggling to regulate and contain the situation

### Playable Themes

- **Survival Horror**: Navigate dangerous environments while being hunted by intelligent predators
- **Corporate Conspiracy**: Uncover the dark secrets behind genetic engineering programs
- **Environmental Crisis**: Deal with the ecological impact of prehistoric creatures in modern ecosystems  
- **Military Operations**: Special forces missions to contain, study, or weaponize dinosaurs
- **Scientific Ethics**: Grapple with the moral implications of playing god with genetics
- **Resource Scarcity**: Make do with limited supplies in hostile territory
- **Factional Warfare**: Navigate competing interests of corporations, governments, and activists

### Timeline

- **2019**: First successful dinosaur cloning by InGen Corporation
- **2021**: Isla Nublar incident - theme park disaster covered up by corporate interests
- **2023**: Biosyn facility breach leads to mainland containment zone establishment
- **2025**: International Dinosaur Control Treaty signed but poorly enforced
- **2027**: Helios Corporation's "enhanced" raptors escape military testing facility
- **2028**: Black market dinosaur trade reaches crisis levels
- **2029**: Present day - multiple active containment zones and ongoing incidents worldwide

## Characters

In the world of Dino Breach, you might play as a corporate security specialist, a paleontologist consultant, a military operative, an environmental activist, or even a black market smuggler. Each brings unique skills and perspectives to surviving in a world where 65-million-year-old predators hunt with modern intelligence.

### Everything is a Character!

In *Dino Breach!* Non-Playing Characters (NPCs), Foes, Organizations, Monsters, and even relevant objects like vehicles are characters too!

Your Protagonist is described by some fixed traits:

- **Name**: The name should be iconic and consistent with the tone and setting of the story.
- **Concept**: A concise description of the character's profession, background, and abilities. The best are adjective-name pairings, like *"Veteran Ranger"* or *"Rogue Geneticist"*.
- **Skills** (x2): Abilities not necessarily character-specific but not characteristics common to all. *"Smart"* is not a skill, *"Raptor Behavioral Expert"* is.
- **Frailty**: Something that could potentially get in the way of the character, either physically, mentally, or socially.
- **Gear** (x2): Particular equipment supplied to the character in coherence with the setting. Everyday items are taken for granted and do not fall under this trait.
- **Goal**: The long-term objective.
- **Motive**: What drives the pursuit of the goal.
- **Nemesis**: A person or organization that hinders the protagonist. It can emerge during the first game sessions, it may or may or not be the direct antagonist of the story, ready to appear to make life even more difficult
- **Luck**: The measure of a character's ability to avoid ill fortune or an inauspicious outcome. It applies only in Conflicts and automatically recharges when they end. Luck starts and caps at 6.

These **traits** are described by **tags**, descriptive words or phrases that can identify anything in the game world. Even the **details** of the environment in which the action moves and **conditions** (physical or mental) of the characters are tags. 

**They are qualitative representations. They are not quantitative measures.**

## Vehicles

## Rules

*Dino Breach!* is a minimalist Solo Role Playing Game designed to be played with only one character (the Protagonist). You'll guide them through the story that will unravel during the game, asking closed questions to an Oracle which will help you overturn your expectations.

Every now and then you will be surprised with an unexpected twist!

### Keep The Action In Motion

A game in *Dino Breach!* is a succession of scenes. 
A scene is a unit of time in which a certain action takes place in pursuit of a certain short-term goal. 

In *Dino Breach!* at each scene:
1. **Identify what you expect from the scene**. Compared to traits, goal, and motivation determine the Protagonist's action. What might be the reaction of the game world?
2. **Test your expectations**. When you are uncertain (or overconfident) about the reaction to your actions, [ask the Oracle](#consulting-the-oracle) a closed question (answer is Yes or No), considering the tags involved to determine if there is an [Advantage or Disadvantage](#advantage-and-disadvantage).
3. **Interpret the result**. Is the Oracle's answer in line with your expectations? If not, in the context in which the scene takes place, how should an answer that subverts them be considered?

This sequence will come to you naturally after some practice. Use it as a guideline the first few times.

### Consulting the Oracle

When you need to test your expectations you'll ask the Oracle a closed question.

You'll need 2d6 in one color (**Chance Dice**), and 2d6 in another (**Risk Dice**).

To resolve a closed question, roll one **Chance Die** and one **Risk Die**:
- If the Chance Die is highest, the answer is **Yes**. 
- If the Risk Die is highest, the answer is **No**.
- If both are low (3 or less), add a **but...**. 
- If both are high (4 or more), add an **and...**.
- If both are equal, the answer is **Yes, but...**. Add a point to the **[Twist Counter](#twist-counter)**.

| Dice Value |    Chance Die > Risk Die   | Risk Die > Chance Die |
|:----------:|:--------------------------:|:---------------------:|
|  Both <= 3  |         Yes, but...        |       No, but...      |
|  Both >= 4  |         Yes, and...        |       No, and...      |
| Mismatched |             Yes            |           No          |
|            |                            |                       |
|    Equal   | Add 1 to the Twist Counter |                       |

### Advantage and Disadvantage

If circumstances or positive tags grant an advantage, add a **Chance Die** to the roll. Otherwise, when hindrances or negative tag cause a disadvantage, add a **Risk Die**. In both cases keep only the higher die of the added type when you check the roll.

Consider tags **intuitively and not quantitatively**, using the context of the situation at play. It is important to keep the flow of play fast and not accounting for advantages and disadvantages numerically!

### Twist Counter

The Twist Counter is a measure of the rising tension in the narrative. At the beginning is set to 0. Every time a double throw (dice are equal) happens, add 1 to the Counter. If the Counter is below three, consider the answer as "**Yes, but...**". Otherwise a **Twist** happens and resets the Counter.

Roll 2d6 and consult the following Twist Table to determine what kind of twist happens. 

| D6 |      Subject       |        Action       |
|:--:|:------------------:|:-------------------:|
|  1 |    A dinosaur      |       Appears       |
|  2 |      The hero      | Alters the location |
|  3 |    An ally/enemy   |    Helps the hero   |
|  4 |  A system failure  |   Hinders the hero  |
|  5 | A corporate plot   |   Changes the goal  |
|  6 |    A discovery     |    Ends the scene   |

Interpret the two-word sentence in the context of the current scene. Twists will keep the plot and events going in unexpected ways.

### Biosecurity Protocols

In Dino Breach, containment is everything. The Biosecurity Level represents how well contained the dinosaur threat is in your current location:

- **Green (Secure)**: Normal facility operations, minimal dino activity
- **Yellow (Elevated)**: Increased patrols, some systems offline
- **Orange (High)**: Active breach, emergency protocols in effect
- **Red (Critical)**: Full containment failure, evacuation recommended

When the Oracle gives a "No, and..." result related to security or safety, increase the Biosecurity Level by one step. When it gives a "Yes, and..." for containment or safety actions, decrease it by one step.

At Red level, add a Risk Die to all Oracle questions until you can restore containment or evacuate.

### Dinosaur Encounters

When you encounter a dinosaur, determine its **Threat Level** by rolling 1d6:
- **1-2**: Small predator (Compsognathus pack, Dilophosaurus) - Threat Level 1
- **3-4**: Medium predator (Velociraptor, Carnotaurus) - Threat Level 2  
- **5-6**: Large predator (T-Rex, Spinosaurus) - Threat Level 3

Each Threat Level affects Oracle rolls differently:
- **Threat Level 1**: No modifier to Oracle rolls
- **Threat Level 2**: Disadvantage when attempting to avoid or escape
- **Threat Level 3**: Disadvantage when attempting to avoid or escape, and all "Yes, but..." results become "No, but..."

### Stalking Predators

Intelligent predators like raptors don't just attack—they hunt. When you enter a new area, ask the Oracle: *"Am I being stalked?"* 

If **Yes**, the predator is hunting you. Until you deal with the threat:
- You have **Disadvantage** on all Oracle rolls as paranoia sets in
- Every scene, ask: *"Does the predator make its move?"* 
- If the predator attacks, all **"Yes"** results become **"Yes, but..."** on your first action due to being caught off-guard

### Containment Breach

When systems fail or fences are breached, roll 1d6:
- **1-2**: Minor breach - Small creatures escape their enclosures
- **3-4**: Major breach - All creatures in one sector break free
- **5-6**: Total containment failure - Apex predators are loose

Each breach level increases the **Encounter Frequency**:
- Minor: Ask *"Do I encounter something dangerous?"* every 2 scenes
- Major: Ask every scene
- Total: Ask twice per scene

### Scientific Resources

Your scientific knowledge and equipment can provide crucial advantages. When dealing with dinosaurs, you may gain **Advantage** on Oracle rolls if you have:
- **Paleontology expertise**: Understanding behavior and weaknesses
- **Genetic data**: Knowledge of modifications or instabilities  
- **Tranquilizer equipment**: Non-lethal containment options
- **Environmental suits**: Protection from biological hazards

### Resource Scarcity

In isolated locations, supplies are limited. When you need ammunition, medical supplies, or fuel:
- Ask the Oracle: *"Are there adequate supplies available?"*
- Add **Advantage** if you're in a well-stocked facility
- Add **Disadvantage** if you're in abandoned/remote areas
- If **No**, you must find alternatives or scavenge

### Corporate Interference

The company's agenda may conflict with survival. When making important decisions, ask the Oracle: *"Do corporate interests complicate this?"*

If **Yes**, roll 1d6:
- **1-2**: Conflicting orders arrive via radio/data pad
- **3-4**: Automated systems work against you  
- **5-6**: Corporate security team arrives with different priorities

### Nature Finds a Way

When you think you've solved a problem or secured an area, ask the Oracle: *"Does nature surprise me?"*

If **Yes**, roll 1d6:
- **1-2**: Dinosaurs have adapted to your countermeasures
- **3-4**: Environmental hazards you didn't anticipate
- **5-6**: The ecosystem has shifted in unexpected ways

### Escalating Threats

Track **Alert Level** starting at 0. Increase by 1 when:
- You make noise or leave obvious traces
- You injure but don't neutralize a predator
- Alarms or systems are triggered
- Time passes without resolving the situation

**Alert Level** effects:
- **1-2**: Increased patrols - more frequent encounters
- **3-4**: Pack behavior - predators coordinate attacks  
- **5+**: Apex response - the biggest predators are actively hunting you

### Moral Choices

When faced with decisions about dinosaurs, research data, or survivors, ask the Oracle: *"Will this choice have consequences?"*

Consider adding permanent traits based on major moral decisions:
- **"Protector of Wildlife"** - You chose to preserve the dinosaurs
- **"Pragmatic Survivor"** - You made hard choices to survive
- **"Corporate Loyalist"** - You followed company orders
- **"Whistleblower"** - You chose to expose the truth

### Cinematic Moments

During high-tension scenes (chases, escapes, final confrontations), when you roll doubles on the Oracle dice (which would normally add to the Twist Counter), you may choose to forgo adding to the Twist Counter and instead gain a **Cinematic Advantage** for your next Oracle roll.

Describe how the environment, timing, or circumstances provide a dramatic edge—this grants you **Advantage** on your next Oracle question as fate conspires to help you in a crucial moment.

### Conflicts

A *Conflict* is any situation in which opponents clash, attacking, defending, or wearing each other down in order to win.
This applies both in a practical and metaphorical sense. 

So, a Conflict is not only limited to combat (or fighting) in the strict sense but also to competitive situations (such as contests, duels, verbal confrontations, etc.) in which two or more characters (including vehicles, of course!) compete.

Conflicts can be resolved in different ways depending on preferences and context:
1. Ask a single closed question. The Oracle's answer determines the outcome of the conflict.
2. Ask a series of closed questions to resolve current single actions.
3. Use the rules of Harm & Luck below.

Note that the Twist Counter **does not apply** to Harm & Luck. Instead, it is used regularly if the Conflict is handled with closed questions.

If the conflict is resolved by applying damage to the Luck trait, roll the dice to determine whether the protagonist causes damage to the opponent or suffers damage due to counterattack or failed defense. The rolls are player facing only.

The damage reduces the Luck of the target, whether protagonist or NPC. When the Luck runs out, the character has lost the conflict.

The final outcome depends on the context. Do you get caught? Are you seriously injured? You may even die if that fits the narrative.

| Answer      | Do you get what you want?                               | Harm    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Yes, and... | You get what you want, and something else.              | Cause 3 |
| Yes...      | You get what you want.                                  | Cause 2 |
| Yes, but... | You get what you want, but at a cost.                   | Cause 1 |
| No, but...  | You don't get what you want, but it's not a total loss. | Take 1  |
| No...       | You don't get what you were after.                      | Take 2  |
| No, and...  | You don't get what you want, and things get worse.      | Take 3  |

### Determine the mood of the next scene

At the end of the current scene sometimes you will be clear about the direction to take, other times you may need to determine the general mood of the next one. In this case roll 1d6 and consult the following table:

|  D6 |   Next Scene   |
|:---:|:--------------:|
| 1-3 | Dramatic scene |
| 4-5 |   Quiet Scene  |
|  6  |   Meanwhile…   |

- A **dramatic scene** does not break the tension of the previous scene but carries it further forward, introducing further obstacles or difficulties.
- During a **quiet scene** there is time to take a breath, to heal, to make plans for the next steps and to deepen relationships.
- A **meanwhile scene** takes place somewhere else, other than where the hero is. It cuts to villains or other plot-important characters.

### Open-Ended Question or Get Inspired

To answer an Open-Ended question, roll 1d6 once on each of the Inspiration Tables (roll at least a verb and a noun, adjectives are optional).

### When the story ends

At the end of the adventure you may add another trait to the character. It is better that this is related to how the story just ended and can be either a Skill, Gear, a new Frailty, or even a new Nemesis! You can also modify an existing trait to better represent an enhanced expertise.

Also update the list of **NPCs**, **Locations**, and **Events** that may show up again in future adventures.

## Exploring Containment Zones

Dino Breach adventures often involve navigating dangerous territories where dinosaurs roam free. Whether it's a corporate facility, an abandoned theme park, or a mainland containment zone, exploration is fraught with danger.

### Moving Through Dangerous Territory

When moving to a new location, ask the Oracle these questions in sequence:

1. **"Do I reach my destination without incident?"**
   - **Yes**: You arrive safely and can proceed
   - **No**: You encounter something dangerous or problematic

2. If you encountered danger, ask: **"Is it a dinosaur encounter?"**
   - **Yes**: Determine threat level and proceed with Dinosaur Encounter rules
   - **No**: Environmental hazard, equipment failure, or other complication

3. For environmental hazards, ask: **"Can I overcome this obstacle easily?"**
   - Consider your skills, gear, and circumstances for Advantage/Disadvantage

### Scouting Ahead

Before entering a new area, you may ask: **"Do I spot potential dangers before walking into them?"**
- **Advantage** if you have relevant skills (Military Training, Survival Expert, etc.)
- **Disadvantage** if you're rushed or moving through dense terrain
- **Yes**: You gain **Advantage** on your next Oracle roll in that area
- **No**: You're walking in blind
