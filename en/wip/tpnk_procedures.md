## Solid Procedures for *The Path Not Taken*

Below are **plug-in procedures** that fit on top of the normal Loner flow (Oracle + Tags).
No new dice. No new stats. Just **steps** you follow and a **Time-Web log** you draw as you go.

---

### 0 · Shared Prep (one time)

| Step | Action                                                                                                   |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | **Start a Time-Web sheet** (blank paper or whiteboard). Mark the present scene as node **0**.            |
| 2    | Define one **Memory Tag** that must survive every loop/leap (e.g., *Loop-Haunted*, *Fixed-Scar*).        |
| 3    | Optionally flag 1-3 **Sensitive Tags** (beliefs/relationships) that temporal play is allowed to rewrite. |

---

## A · TIME LOOP MODE (Checkpoint Play)

> Repeating shards of the same timeline until you force reality to branch.

### A1 · Declaring the First Checkpoint

1. **When to declare**: any time before or during the first dramatic scene.
2. **Mark** node **C1** on the Time-Web. Circle it.
3. Note **Persist List** under C1: *Memory Tag* + any gear/information you insist always returns.
4. Write a **Loop Counter** beside the node, starting at 0.

### A2 · Scene Flow Inside a Loop

Play scenes exactly as normal *Loner* except:

| When…                                                                                   | Do this…                                                             |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A scene ends in **character death**, catastrophic failure, or you **voluntarily reset** | Jump back to C1. Increment the Loop Counter.                         |
| You want to bring knowledge forward                                                     | Add *Recalled* to any tag or note you carried into the next run.     |
| You retry a solved problem                                                              | Roll with **Disadvantage** unless you introduce a new tactic or tag. |

> **Oracle Prompt** for reuse: “Have I pushed this event further than before?”

### A3 · Moving the Checkpoint (“Push-Ahead”)

You can set a **new** checkpoint C2 when **any** of these occur:

* You reach a totally new location or NPC.
* Loop Counter hits 3.
* Twist Counter hits 3 **and** you succeed at the scene’s goal.

Mark C2 as the new reset point. Draw an arrow from C1 to C2 with the final loop number on the edge. Future resets land at C2. Repeat the same rules for C2 → C3, etc.

### A4 · Loop Wear & Tear

Every time Loop Counter increases, roll a single d6:

| d6  | Side-Effect Tag (write on character)                                             |
| --- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1–2 | *Temporal Migraine* – first scene after reset is at Disadvantage                 |
| 3–4 | *Déjà-Flare* – Oracle’s next tie counts as **Twist + “Memory Bleed”**            |
| 5   | *Ghost Echo* – you glimpse another you; add Tag to Time-Web (“Echo-Self @ node”) |
| 6   | *Loop Mastery* – choose one learned fact; it’s now in the **Persist List**       |

To remove a wear-&-tear tag:

1. **Quiet Scene “Reset Ritual”:** Spend an entire Quiet Scene doing something restorative (sleep-cycle, meditation, repairs). Ask the Oracle: “Did the ritual take?”  **Yes / Yes, and** → erase **one** wear tag.
2. **Push-Ahead Checkpoint:** When you successfully promote a new Checkpoint **C#**, erase **all** *Temporal Migraine* tags and **one** additional wear tag of your choice. 
3. **Paradox Boon:** If any Oracle answer comes up **“Yes, and…”** while you carry *Ghost Echo* or *Déjà-Flare*, you may trade that bonus to erase the tag instead of taking the extra benefit.

## B · TIME LEAP MODE (Fixed-Point Play)

> Lateral jumps across timelines—choices can’t be un-made; you only find out what fork you’re on.


### B1 · Setting Fixed Points

A **Fixed Point** is any event the timeline will never let you rewrite.
Mark it on the Time-Web as a boxed **F#** node as soon as it is locked in.

| How the lock happens                                                                                                                                    | What you do                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1 · Declaration** – you (the player) or the fiction explicitly state “this can’t be changed.”                                                         | Box the event as **F#** immediately.                                                                                                            |
| **2 · Milestone Completion** – the first time a major story objective is fully achieved (e.g., “The city is saved,” “The heir is crowned”).             | Box that outcome as **F#**.                                                                                                                     |
| **3 · Oracle Lock-In** – after any normal Oracle roll, if the result is **“Yes, and…”** *and* you decide it should become permanent, say **“Lock it.”** | Box the answer as **F#** on the spot. The Oracle phrasing itself does not change; you’re simply tagging this particular success as unalterable. |

Once boxed, a Fixed Point is final. Later Time Leaps may branch around it, but no scene, tag rewrite, or subsequent Oracle result may undo it.

### B2 · Triggering a Leap

You can attempt a leap when:

1. You’ve just created a Fixed Point **or**
2. The Twist Counter reaches 3 **or**
3. You ask the Oracle: *“Can I leap now?”* and get **Yes**.

**Leap Steps**

| Step | Action                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Draw a new node **L#** to the right of current node; connect with a dashed line.                                                                                                                                 |
| 2    | Copy the protagonist’s sheet **as is**. Add Tag *Temporal Drift +1*.                                                                                                                                             |
| 3    | **Oracle Questions** to establish differences (each is Yes/No):<br>· “Has a key NPC role flipped?”<br>· “Is an old enemy now an ally?”<br>· “Is one Sensitive Tag rewritten?”                                    |
| 4    | Any answer **Yes and / No and** ⇒ add a new world Tag on L#.                                                                                                                                                     |
| 5    | Apply **Paradox Stress**: if you attempt to contradict any Fixed Point, take **Disadvantage** and mark a ✶ on the node. Three ✶ on any node immediately spawn a hostile *Paradox Entity* (treat as Nemesis Tag). |

### B3 · Ending Leap Play

A Leap arc ends in **one** of three ways:

| End Condition          | How to trigger                                                                                         | What happens                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Acceptance**         | You voluntarily stop leaping and declare the current L-node *Prime*.                                   | Retire all ✶ marks; play continues as normal *Loner* in that timeline.                                                                                                               |
| **Paradox Resolution** | The Paradox Entity is defeated, bargained with, or merges with you.                                    | Convert *Paradox Entity* into a permanent Tag (e.g., *Haunted by Paradox*). Leaping is now impossible.                                                                               |
| **Timeline Collapse**  | Ask the Oracle once per Leap arc: “Is this timeline stable?”  A result of **No, and…** means collapse. | **Do NOT** use the regular Twist table. Instead roll 1d6 on the **Collapse Fallout Table** below, apply the result, then auto-leap to a fresh node (L+1) with ✶✶ (two stress marks). |

### Collapse Fallout Table (d6)

| d6 | Fallout (apply immediately)                                                                                          |
| -- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1  | **Memory Scorch** – erase one non-Memory Tag permanently.                                                            |
| 2  | **Echo Overrun** – spawn an uncontrolled *Time Ghost* (treat as Rival).                                              |
| 3  | **World Glitch** – add global Tag *Physics Soft* on new node (Advantage for weird solutions, Disadvantage for tech). |
| 4  | **Relationship Flip** – choose an Ally; they re-enter as a Nemesis.                                                  |
| 5  | **Body Lag** – add Frailty *Chrono Fatigue* until you clear two Quiet Scenes.                                        |
| 6  | **Second-Order Reprieve** – paradox spares you; remove one ✶ and heal one Wear tag instead of gaining stress.        |

*If the new node ever reaches ✶✶✶ again, collapse repeats.*

## C · Building & Using the **Time-Web**

A **Time-Web** is a living mind-map:

```
   [F2]
    |
C1─⊃─C2─⊃─C3
    \     \
     >L1   >L2
```

**Legend**

* **C# (Checkpoint)** – solid circle
* **F# (Fixed Point)** – square / box
* **L# (Leap Node)** – open circle
* Solid line – forward normal time
* Curved line back – loop reset arrow with loop count
* Dashed line – leap sideways
* Tag bubbles – attach world-state or scene tags; erase or add as time shifts.

**Using It in Play**

| Moment             | Action on Time-Web                                                        |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Start new loop     | Arrow back to current C#; increment count label.                          |
| Push-Ahead         | Add next C# on main line.                                                 |
| Add Fixed Point    | Draw box, connect solid line.                                             |
| Leap               | Draw open circle, connect dashed. Copy only Memory Tags + current stress. |
| Big Timeline Twist | Annotate node with bold Tag; maybe spawn new link.                        |

Keep page visible; each mark is a reminder of costs and possibilities.

### Quick Oracle Reference (add to your table tent)

1. **“Have I done this before?”** – indicates loop déjà vu.
2. **“Can I push the checkpoint?”** – if Yes, set new C#.
3. **“Is this event locked as Fixed?”** – if Yes, box it.
4. **“Does this world recognise me?”** – for first scene in a Leap.
5. **“Is the Paradox Entity now present?”** – when ✶✶✶ reached.
6. **“Is this timeline stable?”** – Ask once near the close of a Leap sequence.

  * **Yes / Yes, but** – Timeline holds.
  * **No** – It wavers but endures (add one ✶).
  * **No, and** – Collapse (see table above).
