## World-Ending Threat

In the grand tradition of JRPGs, heroes don't just save villages or kingdomsâ€”they prevent the complete annihilation of existence itself. The World-Ending Threat is the cosmic horror that looms over everything, growing stronger as the story progresses, demanding increasingly desperate measures to stop.

### What is a World-Ending Threat?

A World-Ending Threat is not merely a powerful enemy or natural disaster. It represents:

- **Existential annihilation**: The complete destruction or fundamental alteration of reality
- **Escalating urgency**: Growing stronger and more imminent over time
- **Cosmic scope**: Affecting multiple worlds, dimensions, or the fabric of existence itself
- **Personal stakes**: Threatening everything the protagonist holds dear
- **Ultimate test**: Requiring the hero to transcend their limitations
- **Narrative climax**: The central conflict around which the entire story revolves

### Threat Characteristics

Every World-Ending Threat is defined by:

#### Core Traits
- **Name**: The threat's designation (often revealed gradually)
- **Nature**: What fundamental force or entity it represents
- **Manifestation**: How it appears in the world
- **Agenda**: Its ultimate goal or purpose
- **Countdown**: Current progress toward completion (1-10 scale)
- **Harbingers**: Early warning signs and lesser manifestations
- **Catalyst**: What event or condition triggered its awakening
- **Weakness**: The theoretical means of stopping it (often unknown initially)

#### Threat Levels
As the threat grows, it passes through distinct phases:

**Dormant** (Countdown 1-2): Ancient evil stirs, omens appear
**Awakening** (Countdown 3-4): Active influence begins affecting the world
**Rising** (Countdown 5-6): Widespread destruction and chaos
**Imminent** (Countdown 7-8): Reality itself begins to break down
**Apocalyptic** (Countdown 9-10): The final stages before total annihilation

### Threat Countdown System

The Countdown represents how close the threat is to achieving its goal. It advances through:

#### Automatic Progression
- **Time Passage**: Countdown advances by 1 every few major story beats
- **Inaction**: Failing to take steps against the threat accelerates it
- **Catalyst Events**: Specific world events that push the threat forward

#### Triggered Advancement
Ask the Oracle: "Does the threat grow stronger?" when:
- Major story milestones are reached
- The protagonist gains significant power
- Artifacts are awakened or artifacts are destroyed
- Key NPCs are lost or corrupted
- The threat's servants achieve their goals

#### Countdown Effects

As the Countdown increases, the world changes:

**1-2 (Dormant)**
- Strange dreams and visions
- Animals behaving oddly
- Ancient texts mentioning prophecies
- Mysterious disappearances

**3-4 (Awakening)**
- Unnatural weather patterns
- Magic becomes unstable
- Monsters appear in greater numbers
- Technology begins to malfunction

**5-6 (Rising)**
- Widespread natural disasters
- Governments collapse
- Safe havens become corrupted
- Time and space distortions

**7-8 (Imminent)**
- Reality tears appear
- Dead return to life
- Laws of physics break down
- Mass panic and despair

**9-10 (Apocalyptic)**
- Worlds begin merging or disappearing
- Existence itself becomes unstable
- Only heroes can still act effectively
- The final confrontation becomes unavoidable

### Threat Manifestations

#### Primary Manifestations
The threat's main form or representation in the world:

**The Devourer**: Consumes worlds, dimensions, or existence itself
**The Corruptor**: Transforms reality into something alien and hostile
**The Merger**: Combines all things into a single, perfect unity
**The Unmaker**: Systematically undoes creation, returning everything to void
**The Inverter**: Reverses the natural order, making death life and light darkness

#### Secondary Manifestations
