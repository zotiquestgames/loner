## Summoning

### Summoning Overview

Summoning magic calls forth powerful entities from other realms to aid the caster. Unlike regular spells, summoning requires significant preparation, personal connection, and spiritual energy, making it a rare and dramatic form of magic.

### Summoning Constraints

#### Summoning Pacts
Before any summon can be called, the caster must establish a **Pact** with the entity. This requires:
- **Discovery**: Find the summon's shrine, defeat it in combat, or complete a quest
- **Bonding Ritual**: Spend time establishing mutual respect and understanding
- **Pact Sealing**: Exchange of spiritual energy that creates the summoning bond

#### Summoning Requirements
Each summoning attempt requires:
1. **MP Cost**: Standard mana expenditure (varies by summon)
2. **Summoning Focus**: Special item or location that aids the connection
3. **Spiritual Strain**: Temporary reduction of maximum MP after use
4. **Cooldown Period**: Time must pass before the same summon can be called again

#### Summoning Mechanics

##### Summoning Check
To successfully summon an entity:
1. **Pay MP Cost**: Expend required mana points
2. **Oracle Question**: "Does the summoning succeed?"
   - **Advantage**: If you have the summon's focus item or are at a sacred site
   - **Disadvantage**: If you're injured, stressed, or in an unsuitable environment
3. **Interpret Result**: Success brings the summon, failure wastes MP and may have consequences

##### Summoning Strain
After any summoning attempt (successful or not):
- **Reduce Maximum MP by 1** for the remainder of the current adventure
- **Cooldown**: Cannot summon the same entity again for 24 hours
- **Spiritual Exhaustion**: Disadvantage on next Oracle roll
