## JRPG Spell Casting System for Loner

### Magic in the World

Magic flows through the world like an ancient current, channeled by those who have learned to attune themselves to its rhythms. Spells are not mere formulas but expressions of will shaped by knowledge, experience, and inner power.

### Character Magic Traits

#### Spells Known
Characters possess specific spells as traits, learned through study, training, or mystical awakening:
- **Spells Known** (x3-4): Choose from the spell lists below, such as "Firaga", "Curaga", "Haste", "Barrier"
- Spells represent your character's magical repertoire and provide the foundation for casting

#### Mana Points (MP)
- **Starting MP**: 6 points
- **Maximum MP**: 6 points (like Luck)
- **Recovery**: Full MP restored after rest or quiet scenes
- **Items/Abilities**: Some gear or skills may restore MP during scenes

### Casting Spells

#### The Casting Process
1. **Declare Intent**: State which spell you're casting and your desired outcome
2. **Check MP**: Determine if you have sufficient mana (see spell costs below)
3. **Ask the Oracle**: Frame as a closed question: "Do I successfully cast [Spell Name] on [Target]?"
4. **Apply Modifiers**: Add Advantage/Disadvantage based on circumstances
5. **Interpret Results**: Apply both the Oracle outcome and any consequences

#### Mana Costs
- **Minor Spells**: 1 MP (Fire, Cure, Scan)
- **Major Spells**: 2 MP (Fira, Cura, Haste, Barrier)
- **Powerful Spells**: 3 MP (Firaga, Curaga, Meteor, Ultima)

#### Casting Conditions
- **High MP (4-6)**: Cast with Advantage on Oracle rolls
- **Low MP (1-3)**: Cast normally, standard Oracle results
- **No MP (0)**: Cast with Disadvantage, higher risk of negative consequences

### Oracle-Driven Spell Outcomes

#### Success Levels
- **Yes, and...**: Spell succeeds spectacularly, creates additional beneficial effects or environmental tags
- **Yes**: Spell works as intended, achieves desired outcome
- **Yes, but...**: Spell succeeds but creates minor complications or temporary frailties
- **No, but...**: Spell fails but you avoid serious backlash or learn something useful
- **No**: Spell fails, MP is lost, no additional effects
- **No, and...**: Spell backfires, creating negative environmental tags or serious frailties

#### Spell-Generated Tags
Successful spells create temporary tags that influence the narrative:

**Beneficial Tags (from successful casts):**
- "Magically Shielded" (Barrier, Shell)
- "Accelerated" (Haste)
- "Restored" (Cure spells)
- "Fire-wreathed" (Fire spells)
- "Blessed" (Holy spells)
- "Invisible" (Vanish)

**Negative Tags (from failures or complications):**
- "Mana Burned" (overexertion)
- "Spell Backlash" (dangerous failures)
- "Magically Unstable" (repeated failures)
- "Cursed" (dark magic consequences)
- "Elementally Drained" (elemental spell overuse)

### Spell Consequences and Frailties

#### Temporary Frailties from Magic Use
Magic always carries risk. Failed spells or overuse can create temporary frailties:

- **"Mana Exhausted"**: From casting at 0 MP repeatedly
- **"Spell Shock"**: From powerful spell failures
- **"Magically Vulnerable"**: From protective spell failures
- **"Elemental Weakness"**: From elemental spell backlash
- **"Soul Weary"**: From summoning or necromantic failures

#### Recovery
- Most magical frailties fade after a quiet scene or rest
- Some severe consequences may require specific actions to remove
- Items, skills, or other characters may help recover from magical ailments

### Example of Play

*"The ancient golem is bearing down on us. I want to cast Firaga to destroy it before it reaches the bridge."*

**Check**: You have "Firaga" in your Spells Known, and 4 MP remaining.
**Cost**: Firaga costs 3 MP, leaving you with 1 MP.
**Oracle Question**: "Do I successfully cast Firaga on the golem?"
**Advantage**: You have "Fire Magic Focus" gear, so you roll with Advantage.
**Result**: Yes, and...

**Interpretation**: Not only does your Firaga blast the golem apart, but the intense heat also melts the ice blocking the passage beyond. The golem gains the "Molten Wreckage" tag, and you gain the "Fire-wreathed" tag from channeling such power, though you now have the "Magically Drained" frailty from the effort.

### Integration with Conflicts

During conflicts, spells can be used as actions within the Harm & Luck system:
- Offensive spells attempt to cause Harm to enemies
- Healing spells restore Luck to allies
- Support spells create advantageous tags for subsequent actions
- The Oracle determines both magical success and combat effectiveness

### Spell Progression

As your character advances, you may:
- Learn new spells as additional traits
- Upgrade existing spells (Fire → Fira → Firaga)
- Gain gear that reduces MP costs or enhances magical ability
- Develop new frailties related to magical overuse or specific spell schools
