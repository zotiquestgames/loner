# Artifact System

In the world of JRPGs, legendary artifacts are more than mere equipment—they are vessels of immense power that shape destinies, drive conflicts, and propel heroes toward their ultimate fate. These are not simple magical items but world-shaping relics that carry the weight of history and the potential to alter the very fabric of reality.

## What Are Artifacts?

Artifacts are unique, plot-significant items of immense power that exist beyond normal gear. Unlike regular equipment, artifacts:

- **Drive the narrative** forward through their very existence
- **Possess consciousness** or semi-sentient qualities
- **Attract attention** from powerful forces across the world
- **Require mastery** rather than simple possession
- **Transform their wielders** over time
- **Connect to the world's history** and cosmic forces

## Artifact Traits

Every artifact is defined by the following traits:

### Core Traits
- **Name**: The artifact's legendary title
- **Origin**: When and how it was created
- **Manifestation**: Its physical form and appearance
- **Resonance**: The type of power it channels
- **Attunement**: Current level of bond with wielder (1-6)
- **Awakening**: Special conditions that unlock greater power
- **Burden**: The cost or curse of wielding such power
- **Destiny**: The artifact's ultimate purpose or fate

### Power Levels
Artifacts exist at different power levels, each with distinct narrative weight:

**Nascent** (Attunement 1-2): Recently awakened or weakened artifacts
**Emergent** (Attunement 3-4): Artifacts beginning to reveal their true nature
**Ascendant** (Attunement 5-6): Artifacts approaching their full potential

## Discovering Artifacts

When the Oracle indicates the presence of an artifact, roll 2d6 to determine its current state:

| 2d6 | Artifact State |
|-----|----------------|
| 2-3 | **Dormant**: Appears as mundane item, requires specific awakening condition |
| 4-5 | **Fragmented**: Broken into pieces, must be reassembled |
| 6-8 | **Sealed**: Bound by ancient magic, needs key or ritual to unlock |
| 9-10 | **Contested**: Currently held by another, who won't give it up easily |
| 11-12 | **Awakened**: Fully active but may be unstable or seeking new wielder |

## Artifact Awakening

To awaken a dormant artifact, you must:

1. **Discover its true nature** through research, visions, or elder knowledge
2. **Meet the awakening condition** (varies by artifact)
3. **Survive the awakening trial** (always involves risk)

### Awakening Conditions Table

| D6 | Condition Type |
|----|----------------|
| 1 | **Sacrifice**: Offer something precious (memory, ability, relationship) |
| 2 | **Trial**: Overcome a specific challenge that tests worthiness |
| 3 | **Ritual**: Perform ancient ceremony at specific time/place |
| 4 | **Resonance**: Achieve emotional or spiritual state aligned with artifact |
| 5 | **Catalyst**: Combine with specific material or another artifact |
| 6 | **Destiny**: Fulfill prophetic condition or world-changing event |

## Attunement Mechanics

Attunement represents the growing bond between wielder and artifact. It starts at 1 and can increase through:

- **Pivotal moments** where the artifact plays a crucial role
- **Overcoming challenges** that test the wielder's resolve
- **Understanding the artifact's history** and purpose
- **Accepting the artifact's burden** willingly

### Attunement Benefits

As attunement increases, the artifact grants:

**Level 1-2**: Basic power activation, occasional guidance
**Level 3-4**: Enhanced abilities, prophetic dreams or visions
**Level 5-6**: Transformation of wielder, reality-altering capabilities

### Attunement Risks

Higher attunement also brings:

- **Increased attention** from enemies seeking the artifact
- **Corruption effects** if the artifact has dark origins
- **Dependency** on the artifact's power
- **Transformation** that may be irreversible

## Using Artifacts in Play

### Activation
To use an artifact's power, ask the Oracle a closed question about the desired effect. Apply these modifiers:

- **Advantage**: If the use aligns with the artifact's nature and your attunement is 3+
- **Disadvantage**: If forcing the artifact against its nature or attunement is 1-2
- **Automatic Success**: If the use perfectly matches the artifact's destiny and attunement is 6

### Artifact Complications
When rolling doubles while using an artifact, instead of adding to the Twist Counter, consult the Artifact Complication table:

| D6 | Complication |
|----|--------------|
| 1 | **Attention**: Powerful entity becomes aware of the artifact |
| 2 | **Drain**: Artifact temporarily loses power, needs time to recharge |
| 3 | **Backlash**: Wielder suffers consequences from the power used |
| 4 | **Awakening**: Artifact reveals new ability or hidden aspect |
| 5 | **Calling**: Artifact compels wielder toward its true purpose |
| 6 | **Resonance**: Other artifacts or magical phenomena respond |

## Artifact Burden

Every artifact exacts a price from its wielder:

### Burden Types

**Temporal**: Ages the wielder or consumes lifespan
**Spiritual**: Slowly changes the wielder's personality or morals
**Physical**: Causes exhaustion, pain, or gradual transformation
**Social**: Makes the wielder a target or isolates them from others
**Karmic**: Attracts specific types of conflict or misfortune
**Binding**: Prevents the wielder from certain actions or locations

### Managing Burden

- **Acceptance**: Embracing the burden reduces its negative effects
- **Resistance**: Fighting the burden increases its impact
- **Balance**: Finding ways to offset the burden through other means
- **Transcendence**: At maximum attunement, the burden may transform into something else
