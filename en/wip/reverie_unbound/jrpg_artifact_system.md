# Artifact System

In the world of JRPGs, legendary artifacts are more than mere equipmentâ€”they are vessels of immense power that shape destinies, drive conflicts, and propel heroes toward their ultimate fate. These are not simple magical items but world-shaping relics that carry the weight of history and the potential to alter the very fabric of reality.

## What Are Artifacts?

Artifacts are unique, plot-significant items of immense power that exist beyond normal gear. Unlike regular equipment, artifacts:

- **Drive the narrative** forward through their very existence
- **Possess consciousness** or semi-sentient qualities
- **Attract attention** from powerful forces across the world
- **Require mastery** rather than simple possession
- **Transform their wielders** over time
- **Connect to the world's history** and cosmic forces

## Artifact Traits

Every artifact is defined by the following traits:

### Core Traits
- **Name**: The artifact's legendary title
- **Origin**: When and how it was created
- **Manifestation**: Its physical form and appearance
- **Resonance**: The type of power it channels
- **Attunement**: Current level of bond with wielder (1-6)
- **Awakening**: Special conditions that unlock greater power
- **Burden**: The cost or curse of wielding such power
- **Destiny**: The artifact's ultimate purpose or fate

### Power Levels
Artifacts exist at different power levels, each with distinct narrative weight:

**Nascent** (Attunement 1-2): Recently awakened or weakened artifacts
**Emergent** (Attunement 3-4): Artifacts beginning to reveal their true nature
**Ascendant** (Attunement 5-6): Artifacts approaching their full potential

## Discovering Artifacts

When the Oracle indicates the presence of an artifact, roll 2d6 to determine its current state:

| 2d6 | Artifact State |
|-----|----------------|
| 2-3 | **Dormant**: Appears as mundane item, requires specific awakening condition |
| 4-5 | **Fragmented**: Broken into pieces, must be reassembled |
| 6-8 | **Sealed**: Bound by ancient magic, needs key or ritual to unlock |
| 9-10 | **Contested**: Currently held by another, who won't give it up easily |
| 11-12 | **Awakened**: Fully active but may be unstable or seeking new wielder |

## Artifact Awakening

To awaken a dormant artifact, you must:

1. **Discover its true nature** through research, visions, or elder knowledge
2. **Meet the awakening condition** (varies by artifact)
3. **Survive the awakening trial** (always involves risk)

### Awakening Conditions Table

| D6 | Condition Type |
|----|----------------|
| 1 | **Sacrifice**: Offer something precious (memory, ability, relationship) |
| 2 | **Trial**: Overcome a specific challenge that tests worthiness |
| 3 | **Ritual**: Perform ancient ceremony at specific time/place |
| 4 | **Resonance**: Achieve emotional or spiritual state aligned with artifact |
| 5 | **Catalyst**: Combine with specific material or another artifact |
| 6 | **Destiny**: Fulfill prophetic condition or world-changing event |

## Attunement Mechanics

Attunement represents the growing bond between wielder and artifact. It starts at 1 and can increase through:

- **Pivotal moments** where the artifact plays a crucial role
- **Overcoming challenges** that test the wielder's resolve
- **Understanding the artifact's history** and purpose
- **Accepting the artifact's burden** willingly

### Attunement Benefits

As attunement increases, the artifact grants:

**Level 1-2**: Basic power activation, occasional guidance
**Level 3-4**: Enhanced abilities, prophetic dreams or visions
**Level 5-6**: Transformation of wielder, reality-altering capabilities

### Attunement Risks

Higher attunement also brings:

- **Increased attention** from enemies seeking the artifact
- **Corruption effects** if the artifact has dark origins
- **Dependency** on the artifact's power
- **Transformation** that may be irreversible

## Using Artifacts in Play

### Activation
To use an artifact's power, ask the Oracle a closed question about the desired effect. Apply these modifiers:

- **Advantage**: If the use aligns with the artifact's nature and your attunement is 3+
- **Disadvantage**: If forcing the artifact against its nature or attunement is 1-2
- **Automatic Success**: If the use perfectly matches the artifact's destiny and attunement is 6

### Artifact Complications
When rolling doubles while using an artifact, instead of adding to the Twist Counter, consult the Artifact Complication table:

| D6 | Complication |
|----|--------------|
| 1 | **Attention**: Powerful entity becomes aware of the artifact |
| 2 | **Drain**: Artifact temporarily loses power, needs time to recharge |
| 3 | **Backlash**: Wielder suffers consequences from the power used |
| 4 | **Awakening**: Artifact reveals new ability or hidden aspect |
| 5 | **Calling**: Artifact compels wielder toward its true purpose |
| 6 | **Resonance**: Other artifacts or magical phenomena respond |

## Artifact Burden

Every artifact exacts a price from its wielder:

### Burden Types

**Temporal**: Ages the wielder or consumes lifespan
**Spiritual**: Slowly changes the wielder's personality or morals
**Physical**: Causes exhaustion, pain, or gradual transformation
**Social**: Makes the wielder a target or isolates them from others
**Karmic**: Attracts specific types of conflict or misfortune
**Binding**: Prevents the wielder from certain actions or locations

### Managing Burden

- **Acceptance**: Embracing the burden reduces its negative effects
- **Resistance**: Fighting the burden increases its impact
- **Balance**: Finding ways to offset the burden through other means
- **Transcendence**: At maximum attunement, the burden may transform into something else
