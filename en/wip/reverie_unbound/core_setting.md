## Core Setting

The world of *Loner: Reverie Unbound* is a broken sphere of strata and scars — a vertically fragmented planet where the ancient collision of magic and technology created both wonders and wounds. Ether, the lifeblood of civilization, is harvested, weaponized, worshipped, and feared. From skyborn sanctuaries to crystalline deserts, from corporate arcologies to biopunk wilds, every layer of the world is shaped by its past — and by the pressure of what comes next.

This is a setting of arcane reactors, summonable titans, broken pacts, and layered ruins. Of people modified by biotech, warped by ether exposure, or divided by altitude and access. Of railguns and rituals, rebellion and prophecy.

You are a drifter, a chosen, a fugitive, a remnant — one life pulled into a chain of events that may trigger the **Third Pulse**, or stop it.

### Playable Themes

*Loner: Reverie Unbound* supports a wide range of JRPG-inspired storylines. These themes can shape your character's concept, goals, and tone of play:

* **Lost Technology**: Seek forbidden relics of the Divine Engine era
* **Resistance & Rebellion**: Topple Spire-City regimes or expose ether monopolies
* **Summoner’s Burden**: Forge bonds with ancient entities at great personal cost
* **Wounded Worlds**: Journey through unstable zones and dying ecosystems
* **Identity & Transformation**: Discover your post-human lineage or awaken inner power
* **Fragmented Memory**: Recover lost pasts, overwritten truths, or hacked realities
* **Fated Echoes**: Intersect with timelines, prophecies, or leyline awakenings

These are not rigid campaigns, but narrative seeds. Choose what resonates — your story will emerge from the decisions you make and the forces you confront.

### Timeline

The history of the world unfolds in distinct but overlapping epochs. Each era left behind technologies, myths, or traumas that continue to shape the present.

#### **The First Pulse** *(\~3000+ years ago)*

The age of primordial ether flow.

* Ether first discovered as a raw, volatile force emanating from leylines.
* Early cultures attempted to channel it through song, ritual, and intuition.
* Monolithic proto-structures still found deep in the Nether.
* Some believe humanity was reshaped by exposure, creating divergence into current cultures.

**Legacy**: *Untranslated glyph-cores, forgotten Eidolons, pulse-stabilized ruins*

#### **The Age of Divine Engines** *(\~2000–1200 years ago)*

A golden age of integration between magic and engineering.

* First magitech civilizations rise — floating citadels, ley-powered cities, biomechanical fauna.
* Artificial gods (Divine Engines) created to govern ether flow and climate balance.
* War breaks out as rival nations attempt to seize control of the Engines.
* Ends with a catastrophic resonance event ("The Echo") that shatters the upper atmosphere and floods the Nether.

**Legacy**: *Forbidden summoning frames, unstable engine cores, corrupted guardian programs*

#### **The Cataclysmic Reign** *(\~1000–300 years ago)*

Aftermath and descent into fragmentation.

* Global infrastructure collapses. Sky cities fall, ley-lines rupture, weather destabilizes.
* Survivors retreat into Spire-Cities, underground bunkers, or wild exclusion zones.
* Myths about the Divine Engines become religion, heresy, or propaganda.
* Multiple failed attempts to unify the world under a single banner (The Triarchy War, The Ether Purge Crusade).

**Legacy**: *Shattered diplomatic trust, wild ether zones, nomad kinship lines*

#### **The Stratification Era** *(\~300–50 years ago)*

The world settles into vertical castes and controlled chaos.

* The Ascendancy rises to dominate the skies, codifying ether purity laws.
* The Consortium reestablishes stable trade routes and infrastructure in the Middleworld.
* The Verdant Communion declares sovereignty over Exclusion Zones.
* Myrrik kinships and Eshkai descentholds develop parallel survival cultures.
* The Nether Union formally reactivates and establishes non-invasion protocols.

**Legacy**: *Codified borders, airspace restrictions, factional identity enforcement*

#### **The Current Crisis** *(Present Day)*

Unstable equilibrium under strain.

* Ether levels are dropping in controlled zones but surging in forbidden areas.
* Multiple Divine Engine fragments have reawakened or destabilized.
* Border skirmishes and energy raids occur between Spire-Cities and communion outposts.
* Sightings of new summonable entities and unpredictable atmospheric phenomena.
* Whispered prophecies speak of the **Third Pulse**, a return or rupture of the world’s core flow.

**Ongoing Conflicts**:

* **Ascendancy vs. Verdant Communion**: ideological and ecological warfare.
* **Consortium internal fracture**: sabotage, blackmail, rogue labs.
* **Unstable ley-node eruptions** in the Nether and Glass Wastes.
* **Myrrik prophecy cults** interpreting cosmic alignments and machine dreams.
* **Rogue summoners** seeking to reactivate forbidden Eidolons.

### Geography

The world is vertically fragmented and tectonically unstable — a stratified planet broken into three main levels by ancient cataclysms and unchecked ether exploitation. Each layer expresses different facets of civilization, survival, and collapse.

#### **The Nether**

The lowest level of the world, composed of submerged cities, underground caverns, and arcane catacombs. A place of myth, decay, and hidden power.

* **Sunken Empire**: Once a pinnacle of civilization, now submerged beneath dark waters. Sealed constructs and echoing machines still operate deep below the waves.
* **Forgotten Depths**: Massive caverns and underlayers where ether accumulates unnaturally. Monsters thrive in this twilight realm. Many dungeons, ancient bunkers, and ritual zones lie here.
* **Access Points**: Only Spire-Cities and elite Skyships retain access to the Nether, and only through rare, sanctioned descents.

#### **The Middleworld**

The primary inhabited layer — a patchwork of ruined biomes, arcological spires, and unstable exclusion zones.

* **Spire-Cities**: Self-contained vertical city-states powered by ether. Social strata are literal — corporate arcana rules the heights, while laborers and synth-punks survive the lower tiers.
* **Verdant Exclusion Zones**: Nature reasserting itself violently. Giant flora, mutated beasts, and unstable ley-field storms. Human access is restricted or suicidal without special gear.
* **Glass Wastes**: Once-vibrant plains now petrified by arcane resonance. Entire regions turned to brittle, glowing crystal. Rumors speak of preserved cities within.
* **Transit Rails & Skyducts**: Relics of a former global infrastructure — some still operable, most host to scavengers or rogue automata.

#### **The Heaven**

Above the clouds float sanctuaries of privilege, power, and control. Built on stabilized skyplates and wind-channeling ether pylons, they house the elite.

* **Floating Sanctuaries**: Luxurious cities, research facilities, and aristocratic retreats. Appear serene from below — but many hide experiments, vaults, and repressive agendas.
* **Extraction Fields**: Moving sky-platforms that skim ambient ether from high-altitude currents or harvest it from skybeasts.
* **Drifting Temples**: Vestiges of forgotten beliefs or AI-run observatories, kept airborne by unknown means.

### Cultures & Peoples

The peoples of the world are shaped by their position in the stratified structure of society, their access to ether technology, and their adaptation to fragmented geography. These cultures are not “races” in the classic fantasy sense, but complex social lineages, bioengineered morphotypes, and philosophical adaptations to a collapsing magitech ecology.

#### **Humans**

* **Where They Live**: Everywhere, but most common in Middleworld settlements and Skyship trade hubs
* **Core Traits**: Adaptive, diverse, pragmatic
* **Ether Relationship**: Varies wildly — some fear it, others build their lives around it
* **Aesthetic Notes**: No single look, but often incorporate local tech or fashion into their style

Humans remain the statistical majority and the baseline from which many cultural offshoots diverged. Their role in political power, commerce, and resistance varies by region.

#### **Varnari**

* **Where They Live**: Deep within the Verdant Exclusion Zones
* **Core Traits**: Biotechnic symbiosis, decentralized memory, ritual ecology
* **Ether Relationship**: Revere *wild ether* flows; shun refinement and corporate use
* **Aesthetic Notes**: Bark-patched skin, mossy filaments, glowing mycelial veins

The Varnari live in communion with the last autonomous zones of nature. They encode memory in plants, sing to awaken feral ley-nodes, and sometimes strike back against ecological trespassers.

#### **Haldrith**

* **Where They Live**: Lower tiers of Spire-Cities and transit underlayers
* **Core Traits**: Social camouflage, survival instinct, scavenger innovation
* **Ether Relationship**: Bound to disposable tech; often test unstable prototypes
* **Aesthetic Notes**: Neon-thread implants, custom cyberware, multitone eye-flicker

Haldrith emerged from urban abandonment — human in origin, but long shaped by exposure to uncontrolled ether surges and rogue firmware. Their clans form shifting, encrypted alliances.

#### **Onir**

* **Where They Live**: Submerged Nether ruins and abyssal sanctums
* **Core Traits**: Amphibious bodies, shared dream archives, ritual silence
* **Ether Relationship**: Naturally attuned to dormant systems and submerged constructs
* **Aesthetic Notes**: Smooth, translucent skin, visible pulse-lines, coral or nacre growths

Once human, now something else, the Onir navigate flooded ruins with ease. They act as guardians of forgotten data and secret vaults, but rarely speak aloud — their language is mnemonic.

#### **Caelissar**

* **Where They Live**: Floating Sanctuaries and Heaven-class enclaves
* **Core Traits**: Engineered perfection, political elegance, dynastic obsession
* **Ether Relationship**: Inherit exclusive access to pure ether reserves and research tech
* **Aesthetic Notes**: Bio-sculpted forms, chrome-veined skin, ceremonial filigree

Descendants of elite human houses and early ether-ascension projects, the Caelissar are cultured, radiant, and ruthlessly hierarchical. They fund most arcane-engineering advancements — and suppress access.

#### **Myrrik**

* **Where They Live**: Nomadic circuits across the Glass Wastes and broken leyfields
* **Core Traits**: Oral-historian clans, hybrid tech rituals, autonomous logistics
* **Ether Relationship**: Harness broken or forbidden tech for movement and survival
* **Aesthetic Notes**: Layered cloaks, vox-chime masks, mirrored ocular lenses

The Myrrik travel light but carry deep knowledge, encoded into music, gesture, and map-tattoos. They often hold the only surviving record of events erased by war, meltdown, or decree.

#### **Eshkai**

* **Where They Live**: Hanging colonies in vertical shafts near Nether fault-lines
* **Core Traits**: Endurance, industrial mythology, communal stoicism
* **Ether Relationship**: Direct exposure to raw ether-crystal seams; suffer from mutation or sickness
* **Aesthetic Notes**: Hardened exo-suits, sigil-burned skin, breathing flares

The Eshkai live where no one else will — hanging above the void in ancient mining shells, maintaining rituals that keep the walls from collapsing. Some say they were once miners; others, prisoners.

### Political Entities

Power in the fractured world is distributed unequally across city-states, floating regimes, and subterranean remnants. While traditional kingdoms have vanished, their ideological descendants now compete across layers, using magitech, ether rights, and cultural dominance as tools of control.

#### **1. The Ascendancy of Caelis**

* **Type**: Floating Oligarchy
* **Seat**: *Altara Solis* (Floating Sanctuary)
* **Government**: Hereditary technocratic elite (Caelissar High Houses)
* **Core Doctrine**: Ether purity, divine right of ascent
* **Military Arm**: The Halo Guard (aerial security corps with summoned support)

A cloudborne regime that views itself as steward of civilization. Controls ether filtration and refinement. Allows trade but demands tribute, loyalty, or gene pledges from partners.

#### **2. Consortium of Spires**

* **Type**: Corporate Federation
* **Seat**: *Vell-Circuit Spire* (Middleworld)
* **Government**: Executive board of five megacorporations
* **Core Doctrine**: Efficiency, containment of ether leakage, IP protection
* **Military Arm**: Proxy Security Forces (automated drones + freelance PMCs)

The true economic engine of the Middleworld. They license technology, dominate transportation, and manipulate global narratives through media-arcanes. Rivals with the Ascendancy but economically entangled.

#### **3. Verdant Communion**

* **Type**: Eco-synthetic Theocracy
* **Seat**: *Verd Cleft*, a mobile canopy-city grown inside the Exclusion Zone
* **Government**: Matrilineal councils and mycelial oracles
* **Core Doctrine**: Regrowth through balance, rejection of ether industry
* **Military Arm**: Biothorn Regenerants and symbiotic beastkin

Considered rogue radicals by most Middleworld powers, they oppose arcane industrialization and advocate for post-tech rewilding. Rumors suggest deep alliances with Varnari elders and sapient flora.

#### **4. The Nether Union**

* **Type**: Arcane-Survivor Confederation
* **Seat**: *Aegir Vault*, an ancient ley-core facility in the Nether
* **Government**: Rotating representatives from submerged factions
* **Core Doctrine**: Protection of the old world, containment of sealed knowledge
* **Military Arm**: Leviathan Command and Depthbound Scions

Composed of Onir factions, rogue archivists, and reactivated defense protocols. Mostly isolationist but will strike with devastating force if surface factions intrude on sealed vaults.

#### **5. Myrrik Nomad Kinships**

* **Type**: Distributed Data-Clan Network
* **Seat**: None (constantly mobile)
* **Government**: Council-of-Voices convened via encoded rituals
* **Core Doctrine**: Preservation of oral-truth chains, self-determination
* **Military Arm**: Rapid-response artifact teams and bonded guardians

Refuse fixed borders. Transport memory, knowledge, and resources across shattered regions. Serve occasionally as mediators, but some factions sell intelligence to the highest bidder.

#### **6. Eshkai Descentholds**

* **Type**: Vertical Fortress-Collectives
* **Seat**: *Gravemark Coil*, suspended over an active fault-line
* **Government**: Steelbound Oaths sworn to hereditary stone-lords
* **Core Doctrine**: Survival, sacrifice, silence
* **Military Arm**: Descentguard and Pulsebreaker Units

The Eshkai keep to themselves, guarding collapsed infrastructure and dead elevators. They despise surface politics but can be hired for high-risk salvage or structural stabilization operations.

### Factions

#### Halo Directorate

* **Concept**: Sanctified Enforcers
* **Skills**: Ether Regulation, High-Altitude Combat
* **Frailty**: Rigid Chain of Command
* **Gear**: Radiant Harness, Authority Sigil
* **Goal**: Maintain ether purity and ideological order
* **Motive**: Belief in divine hierarchy and skybound stewardship
* **Nemesis**: Verdant Communion

A militant branch of the Ascendancy of Caelis, the Halo Directorate enforces arcane law from above, acting as peacekeepers, strike teams, and purifiers. They control access to floating sanctuaries and deploy summoned constructs for area suppression. To defy them is to risk being *sealed* — both physically and socially.

#### Verdant Flame

* **Concept**: Radical Symbiotes
* **Skills**: Biotic Warfare, Hive-Tongue Diplomacy
* **Frailty**: Incompatible with synthetic systems
* **Gear**: Living Thornmail, Pulse-Spores
* **Goal**: Overgrow and reclaim industrial zones
* **Motive**: Restore balance between machine and life
* **Nemesis**: Halo Directorate

An offshoot of the Verdant Communion, the Verdant Flame functions like a decentralized cult-cell network. Members are part plant, part insurgent. They infiltrate urban structures and awaken dormant flora to break the concrete grip of civilization. Some see them as terrorists, others as prophets.

#### Cobalt Veil

* **Concept**: Obscured Operatives
* **Skills**: Info Scrubbing, Surveillance Subversion
* **Frailty**: Internal Distrust
* **Gear**: Cloaking Mantle, Memory Bleed Dart
* **Goal**: Expose Divine Engine conspiracies
* **Motive**: Truth must disrupt false orders
* **Nemesis**: Consortium of Spires

A clandestine network of rogue technomancers, former archivists, and burned agents. The Cobalt Veil operates beneath the grid, tracing leyline anomalies and leaking forbidden truths. They specialize in temporal fragments, erased records, and identity disruption. Most consider them myth — until something *scrubs your face from every system*.

#### Forgebound Pact

* **Concept**: Bound Artificers
* **Skills**: Enchantment Craft, Relic Recovery
* **Frailty**: Loyalty Clauses
* **Gear**: Pact-Linked Gauntlet, Binding Core Token
* **Goal**: Reconstruct a controllable Divine Engine
* **Motive**: Restore the golden age of ethercraft
* **Nemesis**: Myrrik Kinships

The Forgebound Pact is an ancient guild bound by literal contracts — written in arcane code and sealed to the soul. Its members are artisans, salvagers, and designers working to retrieve, adapt, or rebuild lost wonders. But every tool they master binds them tighter to the Pact’s secret goals.

#### Scales of Gesh

* **Concept**: Draconic Arbitrators
* **Skills**: Ritual Combat, Pact Negotiation
* **Frailty**: Arcane Obsession
* **Gear**: Eidolon's Brand, Echo-Forged Halberd
* **Goal**: Prevent the return of the Third Pulse
* **Motive**: Stabilize the leyflow through personal trial
* **Nemesis**: Rogue Summoners

An order of warrior-priests descended from pact-binders of the Divine Engine age. The Scales of Gesh uphold balance between summonable forces and mortal will. They challenge rogue summoners to trial-by-Eidolon and serve as neutral arbiters in summon wars. To fight one is to risk judgment — and banishment to the Nether.

#### Aethric Chorus

* **Concept**: Networked Visionaries
* **Skills**: Mind-Link Broadcast, Oracle Cultivation
* **Frailty**: Psychic Feedback
* **Gear**: Chorus Coil Array, Dissonance Spike
* **Goal**: Synchronize global consciousness
* **Motive**: Eliminate conflict through collective thought
* **Nemesis**: Eshkai Descentholds

What began as a philosophical experiment became a memetic movement. The Aethric Chorus transmits shared cognition through harmonized neural implants and song-code protocols. While some join willingly, others are assimilated. The Chorus believes that only when all voices are one can the future be reached — but not everyone consents to the tune.
