### Travel Between World Levels

The fragmented world is divided into three vertical strata: **The Nether**, **The Middleworld**, and **The Heaven**. Moving between them requires advanced technology, specific conditions, or narrative improvisation. Not all travel is legal or safe.

### Skyship Travel

Skyships are the most stable means of level transition.

* **Middleworld ⇄ Heaven**: Authorized routes exist between Spire-Cities and Floating Sanctuaries. Access requires guild credentials, elite permits, or government clearance.
* **Heaven ⇄ Nether**: Extremely rare and restricted. Only high-grade military or research-class vessels can withstand the turbulent descent.
* **Unauthorized Travel**: Smuggler skyships and rogue pilots may offer illicit passage. Ask the Oracle: *“Can I find someone willing to take me across levels?”*

#### Teleportation Circles

Ancient arcane networks sometimes link distant layers of the world.

* **Conditions**: Function only when properly attuned, and often require *Focusing Stones* or matching circle pairs.
* **Stability**: Roll with **Disadvantage** in corrupted zones or under leyline stress.
* **Access**: Forbidden Summons, elite mages, or relic artifacts may bypass circle limitations.

### Wind Gliders & Personal Flight

These lightweight flight tools can ascend or descend between layers — with risk.

* **Middleworld → Heaven**: Possible from mountaintops or spire-towers during fair weather. Ask Oracle with possible Disadvantage.
* **Heaven → Middleworld**: Easier to descend, though glider control is required to avoid lethal descent speed or thermal currents.
* **Not viable for Nether access** due to pressure shifts and arcane distortion fields.

#### Deep Rails & Vertical Arcanodes

Some Spire-Cities contain ancient sealed routes into the Nether.

* **Deep Elevators**: Guarded by corporations or state forces. Often locked behind keycard systems or ritual glyphs.
* **Arcane Spiral Transports**: Occasionally reactivated during crises. Their pathways may shift unpredictably through old ley-paths.

#### Summoned or Living Mounts

Exceptional creatures may ignore vertical limits.

* **Dragon Mounts**, wind spirits, or fusion-summoned beasts can ascend or descend through story-justified means.
* Oracle roll required to succeed without consequence. Apply Frailty or cooldown if misused.

#### Environmental Tags for Vertical Travel

Use these tags to describe the tension, limitations, or cost of transitioning between levels:

* *Restricted Airspace*
* *Seal-Bound Elevator*
* *Leyfield Interference*
* *Illegal Descent Capsule*
* *Gravity Disruption Zone*
* *Smuggler’s Drop Path*
