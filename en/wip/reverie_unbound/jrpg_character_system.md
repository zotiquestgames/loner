## Sub-Tag System

### Locked Sub-Tags
At character creation, all sub-tags are **locked** - they exist as potential within your traits but cannot be actively used for Advantage in Oracle rolls.

### Unlocking Sub-Tags
Sub-tags represent specialized aspects of your abilities that unlock through experience:

#### Unlock Conditions
- **Narrative Achievement**: Successfully use a trait in a way that relates to the sub-tag
- **Intensive Training**: Spend a quiet scene focused on developing that specific aspect
- **Mystical Awakening**: Oracle-driven breakthrough during dramatic moments
- **Mentorship**: Learn from an NPC who possesses similar abilities

#### Using Unlocked Sub-Tags
- **Advantage Bonus**: When the sub-tag directly applies to a situation, gain Advantage on Oracle rolls
- **Narrative Authority**: Unlocked sub-tags give you more creative control over outcomes
- **Specialized Actions**: Attempt actions that would be impossible without the sub-tag

### Example of Sub-Tag Progression
**Character**: Warrior with "Combat Mastery" skill
**Starting**: All sub-tags (Sword Techniques, Shield Arts, Berserker Rage) are locked
**Session 3**: After successfully defending allies in multiple battles, unlock "Shield Arts"
**Session 5**: During a climactic duel, unlock "Sword Techniques" through intensive combat
**Session 8**: After witnessing a friend's death, unlock "Berserker Rage" through traumatic awakening

## Character Progression

### End of Adventure Advancement
After completing a significant story arc, characters may choose ONE of the following:

#### 1. Evolve an Existing Trait
Transform a current trait into a more powerful or specialized version:
- **Blade Mastery** → **Legendary Swordplay** → **Transcendent Warrior**
- **Healing Arts** → **Divine Restoration** → **Life Giver**
- **Signature Weapon** → **Awakened Blade** → **Soul-Bonded Artifact**

Evolution reflects how the character's experiences have deepened their understanding or power in that area.

Gain a completely new Skill or Gear based on your adventures:
- **New Skills**: Abilities learned through experience, training, or revelation
- **New Gear**: Equipment gained, crafted, or inherited during the story

New traits should emerge naturally from the character's journey and actions.

#### 3. Unlock a Sub-Tag

- Choose a sub-tag that resonates with recent story events
