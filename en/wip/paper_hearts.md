# Loner: Paper Hearts

***Loner: Paper Hearts*** is a solo tabletop RPG about navigating the emotional chaos of teen and young adult life. You play a young protagonist caught in the delicate web of friendships, secrets, rivalries, and first loves — all while trying to figure out who you really are.

This minimalist solo role-playing game replaces monsters with mixed signals, quests with personal milestones, and battles with moments when everything hangs on a single word.

## Introduction

*Loner: Paper Hearts* follows the design principles of the *Loner* framework:

1. **Portable** – All you need is a few six-sided dice, something to write with, and your imagination.
2. **Rules-Light** – The game uses a single core resolution mechanic that’s easy to remember and quick to play.
3. **Tag-Based** – Characters, relationships, and situations are defined qualitatively, not numerically.

Your character will be defined by thematic tags such as *Secret Poet*, *Golden Boy*, or *Quiet Rebel*. The story unfolds one scene at a time: a rumor spreads, a promise is broken, a glance lingers too long. Ask the Oracle what happens next, and let the answers guide your messy, heartfelt story.

### What is a Role Playing Game (RPG)?

A role-playing game (RPG) is a type of game in which players assume the roles of fictional characters and act out their actions and decisions within a narrative or imaginary setting. The outcome of these actions and decisions is often determined by a set of rules and game mechanics, such as dice rolls or statistical attributes of the characters. Players may also collaborate to create a shared story or narrative through their characters' actions and interactions.

### What is a Solo RPG?

In a solo RPG a single player takes on the roles of one or more characters, while also simultaneously managing some elements of the game world. These games typically involve the use of a rule system and game mechanics to determine the outcome of actions taken by the player-controlled characters. 
Unlike a gamebook (such as the Fighting Fantasy, Lone Wolf, and Tunnels & Trolls series) a solo RPG is not a form of interactive, forked narrative in which outcomes are pre-determined and limited by the author's choices.

Through the interaction of player, oracle, tools, and prompts, the character's actions will build an **emergent narrative** within whose boundaries anything can be attempted, without predetermined limits.

### Safety Tools

*Paper Hearts* deals with emotional and social situations that may touch on sensitive topics such as rejection, betrayal, or family pressure.
Play in a space where you feel comfortable, and remember: if a scene becomes uncomfortable — change it, skip it, or end it.

### Game Materials

To play *Loner: Paper Hearts*, you need:

- **4 six sided dice** (also known as d6s): two pairs of different colors
- **Paper and writing tools**: at least a sheet of scrap paper and and pencil, but index cards or sticky notes are a fine addition
- **Character sheet**: you may use the provided sheet at the back or a simple index card.
- **Notebook**: *Loner: Paper Hearts* is not a solo journaling game, you can easily play it in the "theater of mind". But you can keep track of you game if you feel the need!

Here’s the expanded **Context Introduction** with a new **Tone & Style** micro-section added at the end.

---

## Context Introduction

*Paper Hearts* unfolds in the emotional ecosystem of adolescence and young adulthood — high school corridors buzzing between classes, college campuses alive with possibility, cafés that double as confessionals, bedroom windows glowing at midnight, and the quiet corners where secrets and promises are traded.

* **Relationships are the real stakes** – trust won or broken shapes the future more than any victory or loss on paper.
* **Reputation matters** – the social world notices, remembers, and retells what you do.
* **Small choices carry weight** – a single word, a glance, or a pause too long can change the course of a friendship or romance.
* **You’re always being watched** – sometimes kindly, sometimes critically, by friends, rivals, crushes, teachers, or family.

---

### Playable Themes

* First love, heartbreak, and the fragile space between them
* Friendships shifting, fraying, or deepening over time
* Rivalries laced with unspoken admiration or attraction
* Secrets that could damage trust if they surface
* Coming-of-age moments and questions of identity
* The pull between loyalty and ambition
* Acts of courage under the gaze of peers or authority

---

### Time Spans

The game doesn’t demand a fixed chronology, but you can frame your story within one of these arcs:

* **School Year Arc** – from the nervous first day to the bittersweet end of graduation.
* **Single Semester** – a short, intense stretch of tension and transformation.
* **Single Event** – one night, one trip, or one festival where emotions peak and choices matter most.

---

### Tone & Style

Stories in *Paper Hearts* work best when they lean into **emotional realism** — the drama feels big because it *is* big for the characters, even if the stakes seem small from the outside.

* Keep descriptions grounded in familiar details: clothing choices, background sounds, glances across the room.
* Focus on **what people feel** as much as on what they say or do.
* Let silence, hesitation, and body language speak as loudly as dialogue.
* Avoid rushing from one plot beat to the next — allow quiet, in-between moments to breathe.
* Show how the social world reacts, not just the people directly involved.

## Characters

In *Paper Hearts*, you play a single protagonist — a young person navigating the push and pull of relationships, reputation, and self-discovery.
They are not a hero in the traditional sense. They are a student, a friend, a rival, a crush, a secret-keeper — sometimes all at once. The drama of their life doesn’t come from battles or monsters, but from **the way people look at them, talk to them, and remember them**.

Your character is the lens through which the story unfolds. Every scene is shaped by what they notice, what they care about, and what they choose to do (or avoid doing).
The game works best when you lean into emotional authenticity — their victories can be as small as a text reply from the right person, and their defeats as quiet as a friend’s glance that says “I don’t trust you anymore.”

**When creating and playing your character:**

* Give them a **strength** that shapes how they face the world — kindness, wit, determination, charm.
* Give them a **vulnerability** that leaves space for tension and growth.
* Think about their **place in the social map** — who likes them, who doesn’t, and why.
* Let their personality influence what they notice in a scene and how they respond.
* Play their contradictions — someone can be confident in class but shy in love, or fiercely loyal yet tempted to break trust.

Remember: in *Paper Hearts*, **you are not building a flawless figure** — you are crafting someone whose flaws and charms make them memorable, and whose story will be shaped by the people and pressures around them.

### Everything is a Character!

In *Loner: Paper Hearts*, **everything that can affect the story is a character** — not just people.
Non-Playing Characters (NPCs), friends, rivals, authority figures, cliques, family members, online communities, and even meaningful objects like journals or shared hangouts can be defined as characters. If it has influence, it gets traits.

Your **Protagonist** is described by these fixed traits:

* **Name** – Choose a name that fits the tone and setting. It should feel authentic to the school, town, or community your story lives in.
* **Concept** – A concise description of who your character is and how they fit into this world. The best are adjective–noun pairings, like *“Quiet Overachiever”*, *“Hopeless Romantic”*, or *“Transfer Student”*.
* **Skills** (x2) – Abilities that make the character stand out. These aren’t just personality descriptors — *“Smart”* is vague, but *“Sharp-Eyed Observer”* or *“Always Knows the Lyrics”* are skills.
* **Frailty** – A personal weakness or vulnerability that can cause trouble, whether emotional, social, or situational.
* **Gear** (x2) – Items or resources that matter in the story. These are specific, not generic — *“Borrowed Denim Jacket”*, *“Vintage Camera”*, or *“Backstage Pass”*. Everyday items (phones, pens, schoolbags) are assumed and don’t need listing unless they’re special.
* **Goal** – A long-term ambition that drives the character, such as *“Earn a sports scholarship”* or *“Confess my feelings before the year ends”*.
* **Motive** – The underlying reason behind that goal. Why do they care so much?
* **Nemesis** – A person, group, or force that actively complicates life for the protagonist. It might not be the central antagonist, but it’s ready to show up at the worst possible time. The nemesis can emerge during the first game sessions.
* **Luck** – A measure of the character’s ability to avoid misfortune or turn bad situations around. It’s used only in Conflicts and automatically resets to its maximum after each one. Luck starts and caps at 6.

These **traits** are described by **tags**, descriptive words or phrases that can identify anything in the game world. Even the **details** of the environment in which the action moves and **conditions** (physical or mental) of the characters are tags. 

**They are qualitative representations. They are not quantitative measures.**

## Rules

*Loner: Paper Hearts* is a minimalist Solo Role Playing Game designed to be played with only one character (the Protagonist). You'll guide them through the story that will unravel during the game, asking closed questions to an Oracle which will help you overturn your expectations.

Every now and then you will be surprised with an unexpected twist!

### Keep The Action In Motion

A game in *Loner: Paper Hearts* is a succession of scenes. 
A scene is a unit of time in which a certain action takes place in pursuit of a certain short-term goal. 

In *Loner: Paper Hearts* at each scene:
1. **Identify what you expect from the scene**. Compared to traits, goal, and motivation determine the Protagonist's action. What might be the reaction of the game world?
2. **Test your expectations**. When you are uncertain (or overconfident) about the reaction to your actions, [ask the Oracle](#consulting-the-oracle) a closed question (answer is Yes or No), considering the tags involved to determine if there is an [Advantage or Disadvantage](#advantage-and-disadvantage).
3. **Interpret the result**. Is the Oracle's answer in line with your expectations? If not, in the context in which the scene takes place, how should an answer that subverts them be considered?

This sequence will come to you naturally after some practice. Use it as a guideline the first few times.

### Consulting the Oracle

When you need to test your expectations you'll ask the Oracle a closed question.

You’ll need 2d6 in one color (**Chance Dice**), and 2d6 in another (**Risk Dice**).

To resolve a closed question, roll one **Chance Die** and one **Risk Die**:
- If the Chance Die is highest, the answer is **Yes**. 
- If the Risk Die is highest, the answer is **No**.
- If both are low (3 or less), add a **but...**. 
- If both are high (4 or more), add an **and...**.
- If both are equal, the answer is **Yes, but...**. Add a point to the **[Twist Counter](#twist-counter)**.


| Dice Value |    Chance Die > Risk Die   | Risk Die > Chance Die |
|:----------:|:--------------------------:|:---------------------:|
|  Both < 4  |         Yes, but...        |       No, but...      |
|  Both > 3  |         Yes, and...        |       No, and...      |
| Mismatched |             Yes            |           No          |
|            |                            |                       |
|    Equal   | Add 1 to the Twist Counter |                       |

### Advantage and Disadvantage

If circumstances or positive tags grant an advantage, add a **Chance Die** to the roll. Otherwise, when hindrances or negative tag cause a disadvantage, add a **Risk Die**. In both cases keep only the higher die of the added type when you check the roll.

Consider tags **intuitively and not quantitatively**, using the context of the situation at play. It is important to keep the flow of play fast and not accounting for advantages and disadvantages numerically!

### Twist Counter

The Twist Counter is a measure of the rising tension in the narrative. At the beginning is set to 0. Every time a double throw (dice are equal) happens, add 1 to the Counter. If the Counter is below three, consider the answer as "**Yes, but...**". Otherwise a **Twist** happens and resets the Counter.

Roll 2d6 and consult the following Twist Table to determine what kind of twist happens. 

| D6 |      Subject       |        Action       |
|:--:|:------------------:|:-------------------:|
|  1 |    A third party   |       Appears       |
|  2 |      The hero      | Alters the location |
|  3 |    An encounter    |    Helps the hero   |
|  4 |  A physical event  |   Hinders the hero  |
|  5 | An emotional event |   Changes the goal  |
|  6 |      An object     |    Ends the scene   |

Interpret the two-word sentence in the context of the current scene. Twists will keep the plot and events going in unexpected ways.

### Conflicts

A *Conflict* is any situation in which opponents clash, attacking, defending, or wearing each other down in order to win.
This applies both in a practical and metaphorical sense. 

So, a Conflict is not only limited to combat (or fighting) in the strict sense but also to competitive situations (such as contests, duels, verbal confrontations, etc.) in which two or more characters (including vehicles, of course!) compete.

Conflicts can be resolved in different ways depending on preferences and context:
1. Ask a single closed question. The Oracle's answer determines the outcome of the conflict.
2. Ask a series of closed questions to resolve current single actions.
3. Use the rules of Harm & Luck below.

Note that the Twist Counter **does not apply** to Harm & Luck. Instead, it is used regularly if the Conflict is handled with closed questions.

If the conflict is resolved by applying damage to the Luck trait, roll the dice to determine whether the protagonist causes damage to the opponent or suffers damage due to counterattack or failed defense. The rolls are player facing only.

The damage reduces the Luck of the target, whether protagonist or NPC. When the Luck runs out, the character has lost the conflict.

The final outcome depends on the context. Do you get caught? Are you seriously injured? You may even die if that fits the narrative.

| Answer      | Do you get what you want?                               | Harm    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Yes, and... | You get what you want, and something else.              | Cause 3 |
| Yes...      | You get what you want.                                  | Cause 2 |
| Yes, but... | You get what you want, but at a cost.                   | Cause 1 |
| No, but...  | You don’t get what you want, but it’s not a total loss. | Take 1  |
| No...       | You don’t get what you were after.                      | Take 2  |
| No, and...  | You don’t get what you want, and things get worse.      | Take 3  |


### Determine the mood of the next scene

At the end of the current scene sometimes you will be clear about the direction to take, other times you may need to determine the general mood of the next one. In this case roll 1d6 and consult the following table:

|  D6 |   Next Scene   |
|:---:|:--------------:|
| 1-3 | Dramatic scene |
| 4-5 |   Quiet Scene  |
|  6  |   Meanwhile…   |

- A **dramatic scene** does not break the tension of the previous scene but carries it further forward, introducing further obstacles or difficulties.
- During a **quiet scene** there is time to take a breath, to heal, to make plans for the next steps and to deepen relationships.
- A **meanwhile scene** takes place somewhere else, other than where the hero is. It cuts to villains or other plot-important characters.

### Open-Ended Question or Get Inspired

To answer an Open-Ended question, roll 1d6 once on each of the Inspiration Tables (roll at least a verb and a noun, adjectives are optional).

### When the story ends

At the end of the adventure you may add another trait to the character. It is better that this is related to how the story just ended and can be either a Skill, Gear, a new Frailty, or even a new Nemesis! You can also modify an existing trait to better represent an enhanced expertise.

Also update the list of **NPCs**, **Locations**, and **Events** that may show up again in future adventures.


## Playing the Drama

*Paper Hearts* uses the same streamlined core as *Loner*, but here the focus is on **social stakes, emotional consequences, and relationships that change over time**.

The following rules are additions to the core Loner framework—they don't replace the basic Oracle system, but give it emotional depth and social complexity. You'll still:

- Ask the Oracle closed questions using 2d6 (Chance vs Risk dice)
- Apply Advantage/Disadvantage based on relevant tags
- Use the Twist Counter for unexpected narrative turns
- Handle conflicts with the standard Harm & Luck system

### Social Standing 
Your character's reputation and social position matter deeply in the halls of high school or college campus. Track your **Social Standing** with the following tags that can be gained or lost through play:

- **Popular**: You're in the inner circle, but expectations are high
- **Notorious**: Everyone knows your name, but not always for good reasons  
- **Invisible**: You blend into the background, which has its own advantages
- **Outcast**: You're on the margins, but you see things others miss
- **Rising**: People are starting to notice you
- **Falling**: Your status is slipping away

When your actions might affect your social standing, ask the Oracle: *"Does this improve my reputation?"* The answer determines if you gain, lose, or maintain relevant tags.

### Emotional Vulnerability 
In Paper Hearts, getting hurt isn't just physical—it's emotional. When facing situations that could leave you emotionally wounded, roll for **Emotional Harm** instead of physical damage:

**Emotional Triggers:**
- Public humiliation or rejection  
- Betrayal by a close friend
- Family disappointment
- Academic or social failure
- Romantic heartbreak
- Being exposed or "found out"

Use the standard Harm & Luck table, but interpret damage as emotional wounds:
- **1 Harm**: Embarrassed, shaken confidence
- **2 Harm**: Deeply hurt, withdrawal from others  
- **3 Harm**: Devastated, questioning everything about yourself

When your Luck reaches 0 from emotional harm, you don't "die"—instead, you have an **Emotional Breakdown**. This could mean:
- Running away from the situation entirely
- Lashing out and making things worse
- Shutting down completely
- Making a desperate, reckless choice

### Secrets & Rumors 
Secrets are currency in Paper Hearts. Every character should have at least one secret they're keeping. When secrets are at risk of being revealed, ask the Oracle:

*"Does my secret stay safe?"*
*"Do I discover someone else's secret?"*  
*"Does this rumor spread?"*

**Secret Categories:**
- **Crush**: Who you really like
- **Family**: What's really happening at home
- **Identity**: Who you really are inside
- **Shame**: What you're most ashamed of
- **Dreams**: What you secretly want to become
- **Fear**: What terrifies you most

When a secret is revealed, it often changes relationships permanently. Add appropriate tags to characters involved: *Trusted*, *Betrayed*, *Closer*, *Distant*, etc.

### Relationship Dynamics 
Relationships are complex and shift constantly. Track key relationships with dynamic tags that change through play:

**Relationship Tags:**
- **Best Friends**: Unbreakable bond, but high expectations
- **Complicated**: It's messy and neither of you know where you stand
- **Crushing**: You have feelings they might not return
- **Rivals**: Competing for the same thing
- **Frenemies**: Friends who also undermine each other
- **Awkward**: Something happened and now it's weird
- **Protective**: You'd do anything to keep them safe
- **Toxic**: This relationship is hurting one or both of you

When relationship tags conflict (like being both *Best Friends* and *Rivals*), use both when determining Advantage/Disadvantage—the complexity makes outcomes less predictable.

### The Spotlight 
Some scenes put you center stage—giving a presentation, walking into a party, confronting someone publicly. When you're in **The Spotlight**:

Ask the Oracle: *"Do I handle this with grace?"*

- **Yes, and...**: You shine brightly and gain positive attention
- **Yes**: You manage well enough  
- **Yes, but...**: You succeed but something goes wrong
- **No, but...**: You stumble but it's not catastrophic
- **No**: You have an awkward moment everyone notices
- **No, and...**: You completely humiliate yourself

Spotlight moments often affect your Social Standing and can create or destroy relationships.

### Text Messages & Social Media 
Modern teen drama happens as much online as in person. When sending crucial texts, posting something risky, or checking social media:

*"Do I get the response I want?"*
*"Does this post blow up positively?"*
*"Do I find out something I didn't want to know?"*

**Digital Drama Tags:**
- **Left on Read**: They saw your message but didn't reply
- **Viral Moment**: Everyone's talking about your post
- **Screenshot**: Someone saved something to use against you
- **Blocked**: Cut off from digital communication
- **Sliding into DMs**: Private conversation starting
- **Subtweet**: Posting about someone without naming them

### Coming of Age Moments 
Certain scenes represent major milestones or turning points. These **Defining Moments** have lasting impact:

**Examples:**
- First kiss or romantic encounter
- Standing up to a bully or authority figure  
- Choosing between friend groups
- Academic make-or-break moments
- Family confrontations
- Identity revelations

For Defining Moments, ask the Oracle: *"Does this change who I am?"*

If **Yes**, you may immediately alter one of your traits to reflect your growth or change. This represents genuine character development through the story.

### Group Dynamics 
When dealing with friend groups, cliques, or social circles, consider the group as a collective character with its own traits:

**Group Tags Examples:**
- **Theater Kids**: Dramatic, creative, accepting of weirdness
- **Jocks**: Competitive, loyalty-focused, status-conscious  
- **Academic Elite**: High-achieving, pressure-filled, judgmental
- **Art Kids**: Alternative, expressive, sometimes pretentious
- **Party Crowd**: Fun-loving, reckless, socially connected

When trying to fit in, gain acceptance, or challenge a group, ask:
*"Does the group accept me?"*
*"Do I successfully change the group dynamic?"*

### The Daily Grind 
Not every scene needs to be dramatic. Sometimes the Oracle helps determine the mundane moments:

*"Is today a good day?"*
*"Does anything interesting happen in class?"*
*"Do I run into anyone unexpected?"*

These seemingly small moments often set up larger conflicts or provide breathing room between intense scenes.

Remember: In Paper Hearts, the real monsters are insecurity, social pressure, and the fear of being truly known. Every roll should feel like it matters to your character's emotional journey.

## Appendix: Paper Hearts in Any World

Teen drama doesn’t belong to one setting.
It thrives anywhere people live in close quarters, care too much about what others think, and keep more secrets than they can carry. *Paper Hearts* is built for that tension — and you can graft it onto any *Loner* or *Geared Towards Loner* game to see what happens when hallway stares and whispered rumors collide with mecha duels, deep-space exploration, or high fantasy court intrigue.

This appendix shows you how to inject *Paper Hearts* into any other genre and make relationships matter as much as the main plot.

### Step 1 — Keep the Core, Add the Drama

You don’t replace the original game’s premise — you keep it.

* If you’re playing **Mech: Requiem**, the war still rages.
* If you’re in **Cold Orbit**, the space station still spins above an alien world.
* If you’re running **Arabian Nights Adventures**, the desert winds still carry stories and caravans.

What you add is *Paper Hearts’* **Playing the Drama** module:

* **Social Standing**
* **Relationship Tags**
* **Secrets & Rumors**
* **Spotlight Moments**
* **Emotional Harm & Conditions**

These run alongside the other game’s conflicts, giving every scene a chance to hit on both the *genre stakes* and the *personal stakes*.

### Step 2 — Translate the Setting

“School” in *Paper Hearts* is just a metaphor for a tight social ecosystem. Swap it for:

* **Mech: Requiem** – military academy halls, training bays, shared dorms
* **Spacer** – station corridors, rec decks, crew mess
* **Arabian Nights Adventures** – palace courts, caravan camps, guild houses
* **The Path Not Taken** – repeating settings that gain new emotional weight each loop
* **Fantasy Adventure Pack** – adventurer’s guild, wizard college, mercenary camp

Think in terms of **gathering points, social arenas, and gossip hubs**. Where do people see each other every day? Where do rumors spread fastest?

### Step 3 — Tie the Threads Together

Make sure the social drama isn’t a side dish — let it affect the main course.

* In a mech battle, the person covering your flank might be your ex-best friend.
* A failed confession could cost you political support at court.
* A rumor about your loyalty might keep the captain from assigning you to the away team.

Whenever a Paper Hearts mechanic triggers, ask:
**“How does this change the outcome of the main plot?”**

### Step 4 — Use the Other Loner Tools

Other *Loner* supplements slot in perfectly to deepen a hybrid game:

**Character Builder’s Guide** – Layer Paper Hearts traits over the lifepath system to create protagonists whose backstories fuel both emotional drama and genre action.
**World Builder’s Guide** – Map the social map and the physical map at the same time. Define cliques, hangouts, and emotional hotspots alongside key genre locations.
**The Path Not Taken** – Revisit key emotional scenes in time-loop or alternate-timeline play. Perfect for testing “what if I’d said it differently?” moments.
**Quiet Moments** – Drop reflective, low-tension scenes between high-stakes missions or plot beats to give relationships space to grow.

### Step 5 — Adjust the Prompts

You don’t need to rewrite *Paper Hearts* tables — just reinterpret them through the lens of your setting.

* *Social Media Moments* in a fantasy game become **rumors spread by letters or street performers**.
* *Clothing & Appearance* details swap hoodies for **guild uniforms or flight suits**.
* *Rumor Mill* results can be about sabotage in the mech bay, a cursed artifact in the guild, or a secret alliance in the court.

### Step 6 — Keep the Emotional Core

No matter the genre, the heartbeat of *Paper Hearts* is:

* Who do you care about?
* Who do you fear?
* What happens if the truth gets out?

The tone can shift — from bittersweet realism to heightened melodrama — but the focus on relationships stays constant.

#### Quick Reference: Blending Paper Hearts

1. **Keep** the original *Loner* game’s premise and main conflicts.
2. **Add** Paper Hearts’ Playing the Drama module alongside it.
3. **Translate** school spaces into genre-appropriate social hubs.
4. **Tie** relationship changes directly into plot outcomes.
5. **Use** other *Loner* supplements to deepen both the setting and the cast.
6. **Adjust** prompts and tables to fit your genre’s aesthetic.
7. **Keep** emotional stakes front and center.
