# Loner Cthulhu

***Loner Cthulhu*** is a solo tabletop RPG adventure set in a world where cosmic horrors lurk beyond the veil of reality, waiting to drive mortals to madness with forbidden knowledge.

This minimalist Solo Role Playing Game is designed to explore the themes of cosmic horror, where investigators delve into mysteries that challenge their sanity and reveal humanity's place in an indifferent universe.

## Introduction

*Loner Cthulhu* follows the following design principles:

1. **Portable**: to play you will need a few common (six-sided) dice and writing materials. Anything else is optional and not essential.
2. **Rules-Light**: the game relies on a few rules and only one solving mechanic, easy to learn and eventually to memorize.
3. **Tag-based**: characters and situations are defined only by qualitative descriptors and no quantitative characteristics.

With a focus on quick resolutions, **Loner Cthulhu** throws you headfirst into the heart of cosmic horror. Your character will be defined by thematic tags like *Scholarly*, *Occultist*, *Traumatized*, or *Ancient Bloodline*.

### What is a Role Playing Game (RPG)?
A role-playing game (RPG) is a type of game in which players assume the roles of fictional characters and act out their actions and decisions within a narrative or imaginary setting. The outcome of these actions and decisions is often determined by a set of rules and game mechanics, such as dice rolls or statistical attributes of the characters. Players may also collaborate to create a shared story or narrative through their characters' actions and interactions.

### What is a Solo RPG?

In a solo RPG a single player takes on the roles of one or more characters, while also simultaneously managing some elements of the game world. These games typically involve the use of a rule system and game mechanics to determine the outcome of actions taken by the player-controlled characters. 
Unlike a gamebook (such as the Fighting Fantasy, Lone Wolf, and Tunnels & Trolls series) a solo RPG is not a form of interactive, forked narrative in which outcomes are pre-determined and limited by the author's choices.

Through the interaction of player, oracle, tools, and prompts, the character's actions will build an **emergent narrative** within whose boundaries anything can be attempted, without predetermined limits.

### Safety Tools
You will play alone, but be sure to play in an environment that is comfortable for you, without overexerting yourself, and reserve the option to stop as soon as you feel uncomfortable for any reason, physical or emotional. Cosmic horror can involve disturbing themes of madness, body horror, and existential dread. Don't be afraid to tackle new themes, but do so in full awareness of your boundaries.

### Minimum Requirements
To play *Loner Cthulhu* you will need:
- **4 six sided dice** (also known as d6s): two pairs of different colors
- **Paper and writing tools**: at least a sheet of scrap paper and and pencil, but index cards or sticky notes are a fine addition
- **Character sheet**: you may use the provided sheet at the back or a simple index card.
- **Notebook**: *Loner Cthulhu* is not a solo journaling game, you can easily play it in the "theater of mind". But you can keep track of you game if you feel the need!

## The World of Cosmic Horror

In the world of Loner Cthulhu, reality is far more fragile than most realize. Ancient entities older than human civilization slumber beneath the ocean, in distant dimensions, or between the spaces of our world. These Great Old Ones and Outer Gods represent forces so alien and powerful that mere contact with their influence can shatter human minds.

The game is set primarily in the 1920s, an era of intellectual awakening and social change, where brave investigators delve into mysteries that should remain buried. Whether they are academics, journalists, occultists, or ordinary people thrust into extraordinary circumstances, they all share one thing: an insatiable curiosity that leads them toward truths that humanity was never meant to know.

### The Mythos

The cosmic entities that lurk beyond human understanding are collectively known as the Mythos. These beings exist outside conventional morality and physics, their very existence a testament to humanity's insignificant place in the universe. They are served by cults of mad worshippers, guarded by otherworldly creatures, and protected by books of forbidden lore.

### Playable Themes

- **Forbidden Knowledge**: The pursuit of dangerous truths that come at a terrible cost
- **Cosmic Insignificance**: Confronting humanity's place in an indifferent universe
- **Creeping Madness**: The gradual erosion of sanity through exposure to otherworldly forces
- **Ancient Mysteries**: Uncovering secrets from prehistory that challenge accepted reality
- **Cult Infiltration**: Investigating secretive organizations that worship dark entities
- **Body Horror**: Confronting unnatural transformations and alien anatomies
- **Temporal Displacement**: Experiencing non-linear time and alternate realities
- **Family Curses**: Inherited connections to the Mythos through bloodline or artifact

### Timeline

- **Pre-History**: The Great Old Ones rule the Earth before humanity's rise
- **Ancient Times**: First human contact with Mythos entities; creation of forbidden texts
- **Dark Ages**: Suppression of Mythos knowledge by religious institutions
- **Renaissance**: Rediscovery of ancient texts and renewed occult investigation
- **Industrial Revolution**: Scientific advancement begins to brush against cosmic truths
- **1890s-1900s**: Modern occultism and spiritualism movements gain popularity
- **1910s**: World War I reveals the fragility of civilization
- **1920s**: The present era - prohibition, jazz age, and rising investigative activity
- **Future**: Prophesied return of the Great Old Ones and end of human dominion

## Characters

In the shadowed world of cosmic horror, characters are drawn from all walks of life. They might be professors of archaeology who uncover artifacts better left buried, journalists investigating strange disappearances, or occultists seeking power beyond mortal comprehension. What unites them is their willingness to peer into the abyssâ€”often at great personal cost.

### Everything is a Character!

In *Loner Cthulhu* Non-Playing Characters (NPCs), Cultists, Entities, Organizations, and even relevant objects like cursed artifacts or haunted locations are characters too!

Your Protagonist is described by some fixed traits:

- **Name**: The name should be iconic and consistent with the tone and setting of the story.
- **Concept**: A concise description of the character's profession, background, and abilities. The best are adjective-name pairings, like *"Determined Reporter"* or *"Traumatized War Veteran"*.
- **Skills** (x2): Abilities not necessarily character-specific but not characteristics common to all. *"Smart"* is not a skill, *"Ancient Languages"* is.
- **Frailty**: Something that could potentially get in the way of the character, either physically, mentally, or socially.
- **Gear** (x2): Particular equipment supplied to the character in coherence with the setting. Everyday items are taken for granted and do not fall under this trait.
- **Goal**: The long-term objective.
- **Motive**: What drives the pursuit of the goal.
- **Nemesis**: A person or organization that hinders the protagonist. It can emerge during the first game sessions, it may or may or not be the direct antagonist of the story, ready to appear to make life even more difficult
- **Luck**: The measure of a character's ability to avoid ill fortune or an inauspicious outcome. It applies only in Conflicts and automatically recharges when they end. Luck starts and caps at 6.
- **Sanity**: The character's mental stability and grip on reality. Starts at 6 and decreases through exposure to cosmic horrors. When it reaches 0, the character suffers a complete mental breakdown.

These **traits** are described by **tags**, descriptive words or phrases that can identify anything in the game world. Even the **details** of the environment in which the action moves and **conditions** (physical or mental) of the characters are tags. 

**They are qualitative representations. They are not quantitative measures.**

## Rules

*Loner Cthulhu* is a minimalist Solo Role Playing Game designed to be played with only one character (the Protagonist). You'll guide them through the story that will unravel during the game, asking closed questions to an Oracle which will help you overturn your expectations.

Every now and then you will be surprised with an unexpected twist!

### Keep The Action In Motion

A game in *Loner Cthulhu* is a succession of scenes. 
A scene is a unit of time in which a certain action takes place in pursuit of a certain short-term goal. 

In *Loner Cthulhu* at each scene:
1. **Identify what you expect from the scene**. Compared to traits, goal, and motivation determine the Protagonist's action. What might be the reaction of the game world?
2. **Test your expectations**. When you are uncertain (or overconfident) about the reaction to your actions, [ask the Oracle](#consulting-the-oracle) a closed question (answer is Yes or No), considering the tags involved to determine if there is an [Advantage or Disadvantage](#advantage-and-disadvantage).
3. **Interpret the result**. Is the Oracle's answer in line with your expectations? If not, in the context in which the scene takes place, how should an answer that subverts them be considered?

This sequence will come to you naturally after some practice. Use it as a guideline the first few times.

### Consulting the Oracle

When you need to test your expectations you'll ask the Oracle a closed question.

You'll need 2d6 in one color (**Chance Dice**), and 2d6 in another (**Risk Dice**).

To resolve a closed question, roll one **Chance Die** and one **Risk Die**:
- If the Chance Die is highest, the answer is **Yes**. 
- If the Risk Die is highest, the answer is **No**.
- If both are low (3 or less), add a **but...**. 
- If both are high (4 or more), add an **and...**.
- If both are equal, the answer is **Yes, but...**. Add a point to the **[Twist Counter](#twist-counter)**.

| Dice Value |    Chance Die > Risk Die   | Risk Die > Chance Die |
|:----------:|:--------------------------:|:---------------------:|
|  Both < 4  |         Yes, but...        |       No, but...      |
|  Both > 3  |         Yes, and...        |       No, and...      |
| Mismatched |             Yes            |           No          |
|            |                            |                       |
|    Equal   | Add 1 to the Twist Counter |                       |

### Advantage and Disadvantage

If circumstances or positive tags grant an advantage, add a **Chance Die** to the roll. Otherwise, when hindrances or negative tag cause a disadvantage, add a **Risk Die**. In both cases keep only the higher die of the added type when you check the roll.

Consider tags **intuitively and not quantitatively**, using the context of the situation at play. It is important to keep the flow of play fast and not accounting for advantages and disadvantages numerically!

### Twist Counter

The Twist Counter is a measure of the rising tension in the narrative. At the beginning is set to 0. Every time a double throw (dice are equal) happens, add 1 to the Counter. If the Counter is below three, consider the answer as "**Yes, but...**". Otherwise a **Twist** happens and resets the Counter.

Roll 2d6 and consult the following Twist Table to determine what kind of twist happens. 

| D6 |      Subject       |        Action       |
|:--:|:------------------:|:-------------------:|
|  1 |    A third party   |       Appears       |
|  2 |      The hero      | Alters the location |
|  3 |    An encounter    |    Helps the hero   |
|  4 |  A physical event  |   Hinders the hero  |
|  5 | An emotional event |   Changes the goal  |
|  6 |      An object     |    Ends the scene   |

Interpret the two-word sentence in the context of the current scene. Twists will keep the plot and events going in unexpected ways.

## Sanity and Madness

Your character's **Sanity** represents their mental stability and grip on conventional reality. Unlike Luck, Sanity doesn't automatically recharge and losses can be permanent, but losing Sanity doesn't end your investigationâ€”it transforms how you perceive and interact with the world.

### Losing Sanity

When encountering cosmic horrors, forbidden knowledge, or traumatic events, ask the Oracle: "Do I maintain my composure?" Consider relevant tags like *Scholarly*, *Traumatized*, *Occult Lore*, etc.

- **No, and...**: Lose 3 Sanity
- **No**: Lose 2 Sanity  
- **No, but...**: Lose 1 Sanity
- **Yes, but...**: Lose 1 Sanity but gain insight
- **Yes**: No Sanity loss
- **Yes, and...**: No Sanity loss and gain advantage on next related roll

### Mental States

#### High Sanity (6-4): Clear Perception
Your mind operates normally, allowing rational analysis and reliable interpretation of evidence. You see the world as most people do, which can be both a blessing and a limitation.

#### Moderate Sanity (3-2): Fraying Edge
You begin to question accepted reality. Add the *Unsettled* tag. While you remain functional, doubt creeps into your interpretations. You may misread situations or second-guess obvious conclusions, but you also start noticing details that others miss.

#### Low Sanity (1): Altered Perspective  
Your grip on conventional reality loosens, but this isn't purely detrimental. Roll 1d6 for your current mental state, which provides both challenges and unique investigative capabilities:

1. **Hypervigilant** - Intense awareness of threats and deception
   - *Challenge*: See danger everywhere, even where none exists
   - *Advantage*: Gain advantage on detecting surveillance, cult activity, or lies

2. **Obsessive Focus** - Fixated on a particular aspect of the mystery
   - *Challenge*: Difficulty engaging with topics outside your obsession
   - *Advantage*: Gain advantage on research related to your fixation

3. **Altered Perception** - Reality appears different, but sometimes more truthfully
   - *Challenge*: Others dismiss your insights as delusional
   - *Advantage*: Sometimes perceive hidden truths that rational minds cannot grasp

4. **Compulsive Behavior** - Driven to perform specific actions or rituals
   - *Challenge*: Must follow compulsions even when inconvenient
   - *Advantage*: Compulsions sometimes lead toward crucial evidence

5. **Temporal Displacement** - Experience time and memory differently
   - *Challenge*: Confusion about chronology and sequence of events
   - *Advantage*: May recall or anticipate information in non-linear ways

6. **Emotional Detachment** - Feelings become distant and muted
   - *Challenge*: Difficulty relating to others or recognizing social cues
   - *Advantage*: Immunity to fear and intimidation, cold analytical thinking

#### Complete Breakdown (0 Sanity)
The character suffers total mental collapse. The investigation ends for them, but they may survive with permanent changes. Roll 1d6:

1. **Catatonic Withdrawal** - Complete retreat from reality
2. **Fragmented Identity** - Personality splits into multiple aspects
3. **Prophetic Madness** - Speaks cosmic truths no one understands
4. **Selective Amnesia** - Forgets the investigation but retains other memories
5. **Compulsive Documentation** - Obsessively records everything in incomprehensible ways
6. **Protective Delusion** - Creates elaborate fantasy to shield from trauma

### Recovering Sanity

Sanity can be recovered, but it requires meaningful human connection and positive actions:

### Minor Recovery (1 point)
- **Quiet scenes** spent in genuine rest and normal human contact
- **Helping innocent people** without ulterior investigative motives
- **Moments of beauty or joy** that reconnect you with humanity's positive aspects
- **Destroying evidence** of cosmic horrors to protect others from the truth

### Moderate Recovery (2 points)  
- **Dismantling cult operations** and preventing their harmful activities
- **Saving lives** from Mythos threats
- **Forming genuine friendships** with people who support you despite your strangeness
- **Creating something beautiful** that affirms human worth and creativity

### Conditions for Recovery
- Recovery opportunities must be genuine, not calculated attempts to "game" the system
- You cannot recover Sanity while actively pursuing dangerous investigations
- Some Sanity loss may be permanent, especially from the most profound cosmic revelations
- Recovery becomes more difficult as total Sanity loss accumulates over multiple investigations

### Living with Altered Mental States

#### Using Altered Perspectives
When your mental state provides investigative advantages, describe how your changed perception reveals information that normal thinking would miss. The Oracle might provide different information based on your mental state.

#### Managing Challenges  
When your mental state creates difficulties, work with the Oracle to determine how this affects your actions. These aren't meant to prevent investigationâ€”they change how you approach it.

#### Integration
Over time, investigators learn to work with their altered mental states rather than fighting them. An experienced investigator with low Sanity isn't "broken"â€”they're someone who's learned to navigate reality from a different perspective.

### The Price of Truth

Each investigation leaves permanent marks on your psyche. Track not just current Sanity, but total Sanity lost across all investigations. The more you've seen, the harder it becomes to maintain conventional perspectives, but the more capable you become of perceiving cosmic truths.

**Remember:** Madness in cosmic horror isn't punishmentâ€”it's transformation. Your character doesn't become less capable of investigation; they become a different kind of investigator, one who sees reality from angles that stable minds cannot comprehend.

### Mythos Entities

When encountering creatures from beyond human understanding, their very presence challenges sanity and reality.

**Entity Encounter**: Roll for Sanity loss as described above. Additionally, entities may have special abilities:

- **Reality Distortion**: Normal physics may not apply around the entity
- **Mind Reading**: The entity may know your thoughts and fears
- **Dimensional Travel**: The entity can appear anywhere without warning
- **Time Manipulation**: Past, present, and future may blur in the entity's presence
- **Possession**: The entity may attempt to control your actions
- **Transformation**: Prolonged contact may begin changing your character

### Corruption and Taint

Extended exposure to Mythos influences leaves permanent marks.

**Gaining Corruption**: When exposed to alien environments, participating in blasphemous rituals, or making contact with Outer Gods, ask: "Do I resist the corrupting influence?"

- **No, and...**: Gain a major corruption (replace a positive trait with a negative one)
- **No**: Gain a minor corruption tag (*Marked*, *Tainted*, *Changed*)
- **No, but...**: Gain a minor corruption tag but gain insight
- **Yes, but...**: Resist corruption but become aware of your vulnerability
- **Yes**: Successfully resist
- **Yes, and...**: Resist and gain protection against future corruption

### Cult Investigation

Uncovering the activities of Mythos cults involves careful investigation and infiltration.

**Gathering Information**: When investigating cult activities, ask: "Do I uncover useful information without being detected?"

- **Yes, and...**: Learn crucial details and identify a key cult member
- **Yes**: Learn important information safely
- **Yes, but...**: Learn information but attract unwanted attention
- **No, but...**: Learn partial information without immediate danger
- **No**: Learn nothing and waste time
- **No, and...**: Not only learn nothing, but alert the cult to your investigation

### Conflicts

A *Conflict* is any situation in which opponents clash, attacking, defending, or wearing each other down in order to win.
This applies both in a practical and metaphorical sense. 

So, a Conflict is not only limited to combat (or fighting) in the strict sense but also to competitive situations (such as contests, duels, verbal confrontations, etc.) in which two or more characters (including vehicles, of course!) compete.

Conflicts can be resolved in different ways depending on preferences and context:
1. Ask a single closed question. The Oracle's answer determines the outcome of the conflict.
2. Ask a series of closed questions to resolve current single actions.
3. Use the rules of Harm & Luck below.

Note that the Twist Counter **does not apply** to Harm & Luck. Instead, it is used regularly if the Conflict is handled with closed questions.

If the conflict is resolved by applying damage to the Luck trait, roll the dice to determine whether the protagonist causes damage to the opponent or suffers damage due to counterattack or failed defense. The rolls are player facing only.

The damage reduces the Luck of the target, whether protagonist or NPC. When the Luck runs out, the character has lost the conflict.

The final outcome depends on the context. Do you get caught? Are you seriously injured? You may even die if that fits the narrative.

| Answer      | Do you get what you want?                               | Harm    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Yes, and... | You get what you want, and something else.              | Cause 3 |
| Yes...      | You get what you want.                                  | Cause 2 |

### Determine the mood of the next scene

At the end of the current scene sometimes you will be clear about the direction to take, other times you may need to determine the general mood of the next one. In this case roll 1d6 and consult the following table:

|  D6 |   Next Scene   |
|:---:|:--------------:|
| 1-3 | Dramatic scene |
| 4-5 |   Quiet Scene  |
|  6  |   Meanwhileâ€¦   |

- A **dramatic scene** does not break the tension of the previous scene but carries it further forward, introducing further obstacles or difficulties.
- During a **quiet scene** there is time to take a breath, to heal, to make plans for the next steps and to deepen relationships.
- A **meanwhile scene** takes place somewhere else, other than where the hero is. It cuts to villains or other plot-important characters.

### Open-Ended Question or Get Inspired

To answer an Open-Ended question, roll 1d6 once on each of the Inspiration Tables (roll at least a verb and a noun, adjectives are optional).

### When the story ends

At the end of the adventure you may add another trait to the character. It is better that this is related to how the story just ended and can be either a Skill, Gear, a new Frailty, or even a new Nemesis! You can also modify an existing trait to better represent an enhanced expertise.

Also update the list of **NPCs**, **Locations**, and **Events** that may show up again in future adventures.

## The Investigator's World

The year is 1925, and beneath the veneer of jazz-age prosperity, ancient forces stir. You are an investigatorâ€”perhaps by profession, perhaps by terrible circumstanceâ€”drawn into mysteries that challenge the very foundations of reality. This world operates by familiar rules until it doesn't, and those exceptions will test your sanity.

### New England: The Epicenter

#### Arkham, Massachusetts
**What everyone knows:** A quiet college town famous for Miskatonic University's prestigious programs in archaeology and linguistics.

**What investigators discover:** The university library's restricted collection contains the world's most complete assemblage of occult texts. Acquisition records show suspicious donorsâ€”wealthy families whose genealogies trace back centuries, often with gaps during periods of "family travel abroad." The head librarian, Dr. Henry Armitage, maintains a private card catalog of dangerous materials, cross-referenced by astronomical phenomena.

**Investigation angles:** 
- Faculty dining club meetings always end when certain stellar configurations appear
- Student psychological counseling records show recurring nightmares clustering around specific dormitories
- Construction permits for campus buildings avoid certain geometric patterns

#### Kingsport
**What everyone knows:** A declining seaport with a reputation for unusual architecture and eccentric old families.

**What investigators discover:** The cliff-top mansions contain observatories that track celestial bodies not found in standard astronomical catalogs. Harbor master logs record ships arriving from coordinates that place them in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. The ancient cemetery's oldest headstones bear symbols that predate known New England settlement.

**Investigation angles:**
- Shipping manifests list cargo consigned to addresses that don't exist
- Tide tables maintained by local fishermen don't match published oceanographic data
- City planning archives show underground tunnel systems beneath the oldest neighborhoods

#### Dunwich
**What everyone knows:** An isolated rural community in decline since the textile mills closed.

**Investigation angles:**
- Agricultural extension reports document crop failures following geometric patterns
- Geological surveys identify mineral deposits that shouldn't exist in New England bedrock
- Census data shows population figures that don't match household counts

### Information Networks

#### Academic Channels
**Miskatonic University maintains exchange programs with:**
- UniversitÃ¤t Heidelberg (Medieval Studies)
- Oxford University (Archaeological Research)
- Cairo Museum (Egyptian Antiquities)
- Harvard's Peabody Museum (Anthropological Collections)

**Research requests flow through these networks.** Track publication dates, funding sources, and researcher itineraries to map cult infiltration of academic institutions.

#### Financial Networks
**The Blackwood Foundation** funds:
- Archaeological expeditions to remote locations
- Rare book acquisitions for university libraries  
- Medical research into "hereditary neurological conditions"
- Anthropological studies of "primitive religious practices"

**Follow the money:** Grant applications reveal investigation targets, expense reports detail unusual equipment purchases, and tax filings show connections between seemingly unrelated organizations.

#### Maritime Networks
**Shipping routes that repeatedly feature anomalous incidents:**
- Boston-Charleston Ward Line (weekly schedule disruptions)
- New York-Liverpool White Star cargo (missing manifest pages)
- San Francisco-Honolulu Matson Navigation (crew medical leaves)

**Port authorities maintain records** of unusual cargo, detained vessels, and health quarantines that create investigative opportunities.

### The Occult Underground

#### Book Trade
**Antiquarian dealers who handle dangerous materials:**
- **Whipple Phillips, Boston**: Specializes in Colonial-era manuscripts, maintains client confidentiality
- **Armand Lecoeur, Providence**: Imports European occult texts, speaks multiple ancient languages
- **Chen Wei-Ming, San Francisco**: Deals in Asian mystical materials, has connections throughout Chinatowns

**Each dealer knows their competitors and regular clients.** Building relationships provides access to acquisition histories and upcoming auctions.

#### Collectors' Networks
**Private collectors often loan materials to researchers.** The major collections include:
- **Billington Family Library** (Salem): Focus on witchcraft trials and colonial occultism
- **Derby Collection** (Newport): Emphasis on maritime folklore and Pacific artifacts
- **Whateley Papers** (private): Genealogical records and land deeds from rural Massachusetts

**Tracking provenance** reveals how dangerous materials circulate through academic and collector networks.

### Cult Operations

#### The Hermetic Order of the Silver Twilight
**Public face:** Gentleman's club with charitable activities and philosophical discussions
**Investigation reveals:** 
- Membership roster correlates with unusual deaths and disappearances
- Meeting locations coincide with astronomical events
- Financial records show payments to "archaeological consultants" in remote locations
- Members travel frequently to the same obscure destinations

**Infiltration opportunities:** Social events, charitable functions, business connections through member companies

#### The Starry Wisdom Sect
**Operating method:** Cells in major cities maintain independence while following coordinated plans
**Investigation reveals:**
- Real estate holdings form geometric patterns across urban areas  
- Communication through coded personal advertisements in newspapers
- Recruitment focuses on intellectuals experiencing personal crises
- Financial backing traces to import/export businesses

**Recognition patterns:** Members share subtle jewelry, reading materials, and travel histories

### Timeline Pressures

#### Immediate (Days to Weeks)
- **Academic conferences** where dangerous research gets presented
- **Auction house sales** of occult materials
- **Shipping schedules** for vessels carrying suspicious cargo
- **Construction projects** that may disturb ancient sites

#### Cyclical (Months to Seasons)
- **Astronomical events** that enable ritual activities
- **University academic calendars** determining when researchers travel
- **Seasonal shipping routes** that connect to remote locations
- **Funding cycles** for archaeological and anthropological expeditions

#### Long-term (Years to Decades)
- **Generational cult succession** as elderly members pass on responsibilities
- **Urban development projects** that threaten to expose hidden sites
- **Climate and geological changes** affecting access to remote locations
- **Technological advancement** creating new investigation opportunities

### Investigation Infrastructure

### Information Sources
**Public records provide foundation data:**
- City planning offices (building permits, utility connections)
- County courthouses (property deeds, probate records)
- Port authorities (shipping manifests, crew medical logs)
- University archives (research proposals, expedition reports)

**Private sources require relationship building:**
- Librarians with access to restricted collections
- Clergy familiar with unusual confessions or requests
- Medical professionals who've encountered unexplained conditions
- Journalists who've covered strange stories

### Safe Houses and Allies
**Establish secure locations for:**
- Document storage and analysis
- Recovery from psychological trauma
- Communication with distant contacts
- Concealment from hostile forces

**Cultivate relationships with:**
- Sympathetic academics who understand dangerous knowledge exists
- Medical professionals willing to treat unusual conditions discreetly
- Legal contacts who can navigate official resistance
- Technical specialists for photography, chemistry, and analysis

### Resource Management
**Investigation requires funding for:**
- Travel to remote locations
- Purchase of rare books and artifacts
- Bribes and payments to information sources
- Specialized equipment for documentation and protection

**Track your resources:** Cult groups have extensive financial backing and can outspend individual investigators. Efficiency and strategic thinking matter more than unlimited funding.

## Following the Trail

### Starting an Investigation
**Investigations begin with fragments:**
- A single anomalous document in routine research
- Unusual patterns in newspaper obituaries
- Contradictory historical accounts of the same event
- Family artifacts with unexplained properties

**Ask the Oracle:** "Does this anomaly connect to a larger pattern?" Let the answer guide whether you've found an isolated oddity or the edge of something vast.

### Research Phases
**Information gathering requires time and resources.** Each research phase involves:

**Choose your approach:**
- **Library research:** Safe but time-consuming, may miss recent developments
- **Field investigation:** Faster but exposes you to observation and danger
- **Contact networks:** Efficient but creates obligations and dependencies

**Ask the Oracle:** "Do I find useful information without complications?"
- **Yes, and...:** Discover crucial data plus an unexpected connection
- **Yes:** Find the information you're seeking
- **Yes, but...:** Get the information but attract unwanted attention
- **No, but...:** Learn nothing useful but discover a new lead
- **No:** Waste time and resources
- **No, and...:** Not only find nothing, but alert hostile forces to your investigation

### Building Investigation Networks
**Solo investigators rely on contacts:**

**Academic allies** provide access to restricted materials and expert analysis, but their institutional positions make them vulnerable to pressure.

**Underground sources** offer information unavailable through official channels, but their reliability and motives remain questionable.

**Professional contacts** can open doors and provide resources, but their help comes with expectations of reciprocity.

**Oracle questions for contact development:**
- "Does this person have relevant knowledge?"
- "Can I trust them with sensitive information?"
- "Are they already involved with forces I'm investigating?"

### Managing Investigation Heat
**Certain lines of inquiry attract attention:**

**Low heat activities:**
- Public library research using standard materials
- Casual conversation with willing informants
- Observation of public locations and events

**Medium heat activities:**
- Accessing restricted academic collections
- Interviewing reluctant or frightened sources
- Trespassing on private property for evidence

**High heat activities:**
- Breaking into cult properties or secure locations
- Confronting cult members directly
- Attempting to disrupt ongoing ritual activities

**When investigation heat builds:**
- Contacts become evasive or disappear
- Official resistance to information requests increases
- Strange incidents occur around your residence or workplace
- You notice surveillance or feel watched

**Ask the Oracle:** "Have I attracted dangerous attention?" Consider your recent activities and current heat level.

### Information Analysis
**Raw information requires interpretation:**

**Document relationships:** Create maps showing connections between people, places, events, and artifacts. Patterns emerge through systematic organization that intuition alone misses.

**Timeline correlation:** Match historical events with astronomical phenomena, geographical changes, and family genealogies. Cosmic horror operates on scales beyond human lifespans.

**Pattern recognition:** Look for recurring symbols, numbers, geometric relationships, and linguistic elements across different sources.

**Ask the Oracle:** "Does this pattern reveal a hidden connection?" Use your accumulated evidence to determine advantage or disadvantage.

### Collaborative Investigation
**Major Mythos investigations require multiple perspectives:**

**Information sharing:** Exchange findings with other researchers, but verify their reliability and motives.

**Resource pooling:** Combine financial resources for expensive research, travel, and equipment.

**Risk distribution:** Divide dangerous tasks among multiple investigators to minimize individual exposure.

**Backup protocols:** Establish procedures for continuing investigation if key participants are compromised.

**Oracle questions for collaboration:**
- "Can I trust this person with dangerous knowledge?"
- "Will working together increase our chances of success?"
- "Are there hidden conflicts between our goals?"

### Investigation Climax
**Trails lead toward confrontation with the truth:**

**Preparation phase:** Gather protective materials, plan escape routes, and prepare for psychological trauma.

**Revelation phase:** Confront the reality behind your investigationâ€”cult activities, otherworldly entities, or cosmic truths.

**Consequence phase:** Deal with the aftermath of knowledge gained, enemies made, and sanity lost.

**Ask the Oracle:** "Am I prepared for what I'm about to discover?" Consider your current sanity, available resources, and support network.

### Failed Investigations
**Not every trail leads to resolution:**

**Abandoned investigations** may resume years later with increased stakes and new participants.

**Incomplete investigations** leave dangerous situations unresolved and may escalate without your knowledge.

**Compromised investigations** alert hostile forces to your activities and methods.

**Ask the Oracle:** "What are the consequences of abandoning this investigation?" Let the answer determine whether dropping the case brings relief or creates future problems.

### The Price of Knowledge
**Each investigation changes you:**

Track how discoveries affect your worldview, relationships, and daily life. Knowledge of cosmic horror doesn't remain compartmentalizedâ€”it colors every subsequent experience.

**Successful investigations** provide knowledge but may expose you to retaliation from cult groups, government agencies, or otherworldly entities.

**The deeper you dig, the more you realize:** Most people live in comfortable ignorance of humanity's true situation. Once you've seen behind the veil, returning to normal life becomes increasingly difficult.

**Choose your battles.** Not every mystery needs solving, and some doors should remain closed. Wisdom lies in knowing when to stop digging.

## The Great Old Ones and Outer Gods

The cosmic entities that lurk beyond human understanding represent forces so alien and powerful that mere contact with their influence can shatter mortal minds. These beings exist outside conventional morality and physics, their very existence a testament to humanity's insignificant place in the universe.

### Understanding the Hierarchy

#### Great Old Ones
Ancient beings of immense power who once ruled Earth but now lie dormant, imprisoned, or exiled. They maintain tenuous connections to our reality through dreams, artifacts, and devoted cults. Their return would signal the end of human civilization as we know it.

#### Outer Gods
Cosmic forces that exist beyond dimensional boundaries, representing fundamental aspects of a hostile universe. They are less concerned with Earth specifically and more with the manipulation of reality itself across infinite dimensions.

#### Lesser Entities
Servants, spawn, and manifestations of the greater powers. These include the creatures investigators typically encounter directlyâ€”cultists, monsters, and otherworldly beings that carry out their masters' will.

#### Escalating Encounters
As investigations deepen, encounters shift from human cultists to stranger phenomena to direct manifestations of cosmic power. Each level requires different approaches and carries different risks to sanity and survival.

#### The Ultimate Truth
All investigation trails eventually lead to the same horrifying realization: humanity exists at the mercy of forces that regard us as less than insects. The Great Old Ones will return, reality itself may be nothing more than a dream, and all human achievement is ultimately meaningless in the face of cosmic indifference.

This knowledge is both the investigator's greatest discovery and their ultimate curse.
