# Loner Cthulhu

***Loner Cthulhu*** is a solo tabletop RPG adventure set in a world where cosmic horrors lurk beyond the veil of reality, waiting to drive mortals to madness with forbidden knowledge.

This minimalist Solo Role Playing Game is designed to explore the themes of cosmic horror, where investigators delve into mysteries that challenge their sanity and reveal humanity's place in an indifferent universe.

## Introduction

*Loner Cthulhu* follows the following design principles:

1. **Portable**: to play you will need a few common (six-sided) dice and writing materials. Anything else is optional and not essential.
2. **Rules-Light**: the game relies on a few rules and only one solving mechanic, easy to learn and eventually to memorize.
3. **Tag-based**: characters and situations are defined only by qualitative descriptors and no quantitative characteristics.

With a focus on quick resolutions, **Loner Cthulhu** throws you headfirst into the heart of cosmic horror. Your character will be defined by thematic tags like *Scholarly*, *Occultist*, *Traumatized*, or *Ancient Bloodline*.

### What is a Role Playing Game (RPG)?
A role-playing game (RPG) is a type of game in which players assume the roles of fictional characters and act out their actions and decisions within a narrative or imaginary setting. The outcome of these actions and decisions is often determined by a set of rules and game mechanics, such as dice rolls or statistical attributes of the characters. Players may also collaborate to create a shared story or narrative through their characters' actions and interactions.

### What is a Solo RPG?

In a solo RPG a single player takes on the roles of one or more characters, while also simultaneously managing some elements of the game world. These games typically involve the use of a rule system and game mechanics to determine the outcome of actions taken by the player-controlled characters. 
Unlike a gamebook (such as the Fighting Fantasy, Lone Wolf, and Tunnels & Trolls series) a solo RPG is not a form of interactive, forked narrative in which outcomes are pre-determined and limited by the author's choices.

Through the interaction of player, oracle, tools, and prompts, the character's actions will build an **emergent narrative** within whose boundaries anything can be attempted, without predetermined limits.

### Safety Tools
You will play alone, but be sure to play in an environment that is comfortable for you, without overexerting yourself, and reserve the option to stop as soon as you feel uncomfortable for any reason, physical or emotional. Cosmic horror can involve disturbing themes of madness, body horror, and existential dread. Don't be afraid to tackle new themes, but do so in full awareness of your boundaries.

### Minimum Requirements
To play *Loner Cthulhu* you will need:
- **4 six sided dice** (also known as d6s): two pairs of different colors
- **Paper and writing tools**: at least a sheet of scrap paper and and pencil, but index cards or sticky notes are a fine addition
- **Character sheet**: you may use the provided sheet at the back or a simple index card.
- **Notebook**: *Loner Cthulhu* is not a solo journaling game, you can easily play it in the "theater of mind". But you can keep track of you game if you feel the need!

## The World of Cosmic Horror

In the world of Loner Cthulhu, reality is far more fragile than most realize. Ancient entities older than human civilization slumber beneath the ocean, in distant dimensions, or between the spaces of our world. These Great Old Ones and Outer Gods represent forces so alien and powerful that mere contact with their influence can shatter human minds.

The game is set primarily in the 1920s, an era of intellectual awakening and social change, where brave investigators delve into mysteries that should remain buried. Whether they are academics, journalists, occultists, or ordinary people thrust into extraordinary circumstances, they all share one thing: an insatiable curiosity that leads them toward truths that humanity was never meant to know.

### The Mythos

The cosmic entities that lurk beyond human understanding are collectively known as the Mythos. These beings exist outside conventional morality and physics, their very existence a testament to humanity's insignificant place in the universe. They are served by cults of mad worshippers, guarded by otherworldly creatures, and protected by books of forbidden lore.

### Playable Themes

- **Forbidden Knowledge**: The pursuit of dangerous truths that come at a terrible cost
- **Cosmic Insignificance**: Confronting humanity's place in an indifferent universe
- **Creeping Madness**: The gradual erosion of sanity through exposure to otherworldly forces
- **Ancient Mysteries**: Uncovering secrets from prehistory that challenge accepted reality
- **Cult Infiltration**: Investigating secretive organizations that worship dark entities
- **Body Horror**: Confronting unnatural transformations and alien anatomies
- **Temporal Displacement**: Experiencing non-linear time and alternate realities
- **Family Curses**: Inherited connections to the Mythos through bloodline or artifact

### Timeline

- **Pre-History**: The Great Old Ones rule the Earth before humanity's rise
- **Ancient Times**: First human contact with Mythos entities; creation of forbidden texts
- **Dark Ages**: Suppression of Mythos knowledge by religious institutions
- **Renaissance**: Rediscovery of ancient texts and renewed occult investigation
- **Industrial Revolution**: Scientific advancement begins to brush against cosmic truths
- **1890s-1900s**: Modern occultism and spiritualism movements gain popularity
- **1910s**: World War I reveals the fragility of civilization
- **1920s**: The present era - prohibition, jazz age, and rising investigative activity
- **Future**: Prophesied return of the Great Old Ones and end of human dominion

## Characters

In the shadowed world of cosmic horror, characters are drawn from all walks of life. They might be professors of archaeology who uncover artifacts better left buried, journalists investigating strange disappearances, or occultists seeking power beyond mortal comprehension. What unites them is their willingness to peer into the abyss—often at great personal cost.

### Everything is a Character!

In *Loner Cthulhu* Non-Playing Characters (NPCs), Cultists, Entities, Organizations, and even relevant objects like cursed artifacts or haunted locations are characters too!

Your Protagonist is described by some fixed traits:

- **Name**: The name should be iconic and consistent with the tone and setting of the story.
- **Concept**: A concise description of the character's profession, background, and abilities. The best are adjective-name pairings, like *"Determined Reporter"* or *"Traumatized War Veteran"*.
- **Skills** (x2): Abilities not necessarily character-specific but not characteristics common to all. *"Smart"* is not a skill, *"Ancient Languages"* is.
- **Frailty**: Something that could potentially get in the way of the character, either physically, mentally, or socially.
- **Gear** (x2): Particular equipment supplied to the character in coherence with the setting. Everyday items are taken for granted and do not fall under this trait.
- **Goal**: The long-term objective.
- **Motive**: What drives the pursuit of the goal.
- **Nemesis**: A person or organization that hinders the protagonist. It can emerge during the first game sessions, it may or may or not be the direct antagonist of the story, ready to appear to make life even more difficult
- **Luck**: The measure of a character's ability to avoid ill fortune or an inauspicious outcome. It applies only in Conflicts and automatically recharges when they end. Luck starts and caps at 6.
- **Sanity**: The character's mental stability and grip on reality. Starts at 6 and decreases through exposure to cosmic horrors. When it reaches 0, the character suffers a complete mental breakdown.

These **traits** are described by **tags**, descriptive words or phrases that can identify anything in the game world. Even the **details** of the environment in which the action moves and **conditions** (physical or mental) of the characters are tags. 

**They are qualitative representations. They are not quantitative measures.**

## Rules

*Loner Cthulhu* is a minimalist Solo Role Playing Game designed to be played with only one character (the Protagonist). You'll guide them through the story that will unravel during the game, asking closed questions to an Oracle which will help you overturn your expectations.

Every now and then you will be surprised with an unexpected twist!

### Keep The Action In Motion

A game in *Loner Cthulhu* is a succession of scenes. 
A scene is a unit of time in which a certain action takes place in pursuit of a certain short-term goal. 

In *Loner Cthulhu* at each scene:
1. **Identify what you expect from the scene**. Compared to traits, goal, and motivation determine the Protagonist's action. What might be the reaction of the game world?
2. **Test your expectations**. When you are uncertain (or overconfident) about the reaction to your actions, [ask the Oracle](#consulting-the-oracle) a closed question (answer is Yes or No), considering the tags involved to determine if there is an [Advantage or Disadvantage](#advantage-and-disadvantage).
3. **Interpret the result**. Is the Oracle's answer in line with your expectations? If not, in the context in which the scene takes place, how should an answer that subverts them be considered?

This sequence will come to you naturally after some practice. Use it as a guideline the first few times.

### Consulting the Oracle

When you need to test your expectations you'll ask the Oracle a closed question.

You'll need 2d6 in one color (**Chance Dice**), and 2d6 in another (**Risk Dice**).

To resolve a closed question, roll one **Chance Die** and one **Risk Die**:
- If the Chance Die is highest, the answer is **Yes**. 
- If the Risk Die is highest, the answer is **No**.
- If both are low (3 or less), add a **but...**. 
- If both are high (4 or more), add an **and...**.
- If both are equal, the answer is **Yes, but...**. Add a point to the **[Twist Counter](#twist-counter)**.

| Dice Value |    Chance Die > Risk Die   | Risk Die > Chance Die |
|:----------:|:--------------------------:|:---------------------:|
|  Both < 4  |         Yes, but...        |       No, but...      |
|  Both > 3  |         Yes, and...        |       No, and...      |
| Mismatched |             Yes            |           No          |
|            |                            |                       |
|    Equal   | Add 1 to the Twist Counter |                       |

### Advantage and Disadvantage

If circumstances or positive tags grant an advantage, add a **Chance Die** to the roll. Otherwise, when hindrances or negative tag cause a disadvantage, add a **Risk Die**. In both cases keep only the higher die of the added type when you check the roll.

Consider tags **intuitively and not quantitatively**, using the context of the situation at play. It is important to keep the flow of play fast and not accounting for advantages and disadvantages numerically!

### Twist Counter

The Twist Counter is a measure of the rising tension in the narrative. At the beginning is set to 0. Every time a double throw (dice are equal) happens, add 1 to the Counter. If the Counter is below three, consider the answer as "**Yes, but...**". Otherwise a **Twist** happens and resets the Counter.

Roll 2d6 and consult the following Twist Table to determine what kind of twist happens. 

| D6 |      Subject       |        Action       |
|:--:|:------------------:|:-------------------:|
|  1 |    A third party   |       Appears       |
|  2 |      The hero      | Alters the location |
|  3 |    An encounter    |    Helps the hero   |
|  4 |  A physical event  |   Hinders the hero  |
|  5 | An emotional event |   Changes the goal  |
|  6 |      An object     |    Ends the scene   |

Interpret the two-word sentence in the context of the current scene. Twists will keep the plot and events going in unexpected ways.

### Cosmic Horror Rules

These genre-specific rules capture the unique elements of cosmic horror using the oracular system.

#### Sanity and Madness

Your character's **Sanity** represents their mental stability and grip on reality. Unlike Luck, Sanity doesn't automatically recharge and losses are often permanent.

**Losing Sanity**: When encountering cosmic horrors, forbidden knowledge, or traumatic events, ask the Oracle: "Do I maintain my composure?" Consider relevant tags like *Scholarly*, *Traumatized*, *Occult Lore*, etc.

- **No, and...**: Lose 3 Sanity
- **No**: Lose 2 Sanity  
- **No, but...**: Lose 1 Sanity
- **Yes, but...**: Lose 1 Sanity but gain insight
- **Yes**: No Sanity loss
- **Yes, and...**: No Sanity loss and gain advantage on next related roll

**Temporary Madness** (Sanity 3-1): Add the *Unstable* tag. Roll 1d6 for a temporary affliction:
1. **Paranoia** - Everyone is potentially hostile
2. **Obsession** - Fixated on a particular aspect of the mystery
3. **Phobia** - Intense fear of something encountered
4. **Compulsion** - Must perform specific ritual behaviors
5. **Delusion** - Believes something untrue about reality
6. **Catatonia** - Temporary complete withdrawal

**Indefinite Madness** (Sanity 0): The character suffers complete mental breakdown. Roll 1d6:
1. **Amnesia** - Forget everything about the investigation
2. **Multiple Personality** - Develop alternate identity
3. **Homicidal Mania** - Compelled to violence
4. **Catatonia** - Permanent withdrawal from reality
5. **Megalomania** - Believe you have cosmic power
6. **Suicidal Depression** - Overwhelming despair

#### Forbidden Knowledge

Learning cosmic truths always comes with a price. When studying eldritch tomes, deciphering alien symbols, or comprehending otherworldly phenomena:

**Gaining Insight**: Ask the Oracle: "Do I understand this forbidden knowledge?" Consider relevant skills like *Ancient Languages*, *Occult Lore*, etc.

- **Yes, and...**: Gain crucial knowledge and a new useful tag, but lose 1 Sanity
- **Yes**: Gain the knowledge, lose 1 Sanity
- **Yes, but...**: Partial knowledge gained, lose 2 Sanity
- **No, but...**: No knowledge gained but no immediate Sanity loss
- **No**: No knowledge gained, lose 1 Sanity from the attempt
- **No, and...**: Misunderstand the knowledge (gain false information), lose 2 Sanity

#### Mythos Entities

When encountering creatures from beyond human understanding, their very presence challenges sanity and reality.

**Entity Encounter**: Roll for Sanity loss as described above. Additionally, entities may have special abilities:

- **Reality Distortion**: Normal physics may not apply around the entity
- **Mind Reading**: The entity may know your thoughts and fears
- **Dimensional Travel**: The entity can appear anywhere without warning
- **Time Manipulation**: Past, present, and future may blur in the entity's presence
- **Possession**: The entity may attempt to control your actions
- **Transformation**: Prolonged contact may begin changing your character

#### Corruption and Taint

Extended exposure to Mythos influences leaves permanent marks.

**Gaining Corruption**: When exposed to alien environments, participating in blasphemous rituals, or making contact with Outer Gods, ask: "Do I resist the corrupting influence?"

- **No, and...**: Gain a major corruption (replace a positive trait with a negative one)
- **No**: Gain a minor corruption tag (*Marked*, *Tainted*, *Changed*)
- **No, but...**: Gain a minor corruption tag but gain insight
- **Yes, but...**: Resist corruption but become aware of your vulnerability
- **Yes**: Successfully resist
- **Yes, and...**: Resist and gain protection against future corruption

#### Cult Investigation

Uncovering the activities of Mythos cults involves careful investigation and infiltration.

**Gathering Information**: When investigating cult activities, ask: "Do I uncover useful information without being detected?"

- **Yes, and...**: Learn crucial details and identify a key cult member
- **Yes**: Learn important information safely
- **Yes, but...**: Learn information but attract unwanted attention
- **No, but...**: Learn partial information without immediate danger
- **No**: Learn nothing and waste time
- **No, and...**: Not only learn nothing, but alert the cult to your investigation

### Conflicts

A *Conflict* is any situation in which opponents clash, attacking, defending, or wearing each other down in order to win.
This applies both in a practical and metaphorical sense. 

So, a Conflict is not only limited to combat (or fighting) in the strict sense but also to competitive situations (such as contests, duels, verbal confrontations, etc.) in which two or more characters (including vehicles, of course!) compete.

Conflicts can be resolved in different ways depending on preferences and context:
1. Ask a single closed question. The Oracle's answer determines the outcome of the conflict.
2. Ask a series of closed questions to resolve current single actions.
3. Use the rules of Harm & Luck below.

Note that the Twist Counter **does not apply** to Harm & Luck. Instead, it is used regularly if the Conflict is handled with closed questions.

If the conflict is resolved by applying damage to the Luck trait, roll the dice to determine whether the protagonist causes damage to the opponent or suffers damage due to counterattack or failed defense. The rolls are player facing only.

The damage reduces the Luck of the target, whether protagonist or NPC. When the Luck runs out, the character has lost the conflict.

The final outcome depends on the context. Do you get caught? Are you seriously injured? You may even die if that fits the narrative.

| Answer      | Do you get what you want?                               | Harm    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Yes, and... | You get what you want, and something else.              | Cause 3 |
| Yes...      | You get what you want.                                  | Cause 2 |
| Yes, but... | You get what you want, but at a cost.                   | Cause 1 |
| No, but...  | You don't get what you want, but it's not a total loss. | Take 1  |
| No...       | You don't get what you were after.                      | Take 2  |
| No, and...  | You don't get what you want, and things get worse.      | Take 3  |

### Determine the mood of the next scene

At the end of the current scene sometimes you will be clear about the direction to take, other times you may need to determine the general mood of the next one. In this case roll 1d6 and consult the following table:

|  D6 |   Next Scene   |
|:---:|:--------------:|
| 1-3 | Dramatic scene |
| 4-5 |   Quiet Scene  |
|  6  |   Meanwhile…   |

- A **dramatic scene** does not break the tension of the previous scene but carries it further forward, introducing further obstacles or difficulties.
- During a **quiet scene** there is time to take a breath, to heal, to make plans for the next steps and to deepen relationships.
- A **meanwhile scene** takes place somewhere else, other than where the hero is. It cuts to villains or other plot-important characters.

### Open-Ended Question or Get Inspired

To answer an Open-Ended question, roll 1d6 once on each of the Inspiration Tables (roll at least a verb and a noun, adjectives are optional).

### When the story ends

At the end of the adventure you may add another trait to the character. It is better that this is related to how the story just ended and can be either a Skill, Gear, a new Frailty, or even a new Nemesis! You can also modify an existing trait to better represent an enhanced expertise.

Also update the list of **NPCs**, **Locations**, and **Events** that may show up again in future adventures.

## Exploring the Mythos

Loner Cthulhu focuses on investigation and gradual revelation of cosmic horrors rather than geographical exploration. However, characters may need to travel to specific locations—whether ancient sites, modern cities with dark secrets, or otherworldly dimensions.

### Preparation

* **Define Your Destination:** Choose a specific location from your notes or have the Oracle determine where the investigation leads next.
* **Research the Location:** Use relevant skills like *Library Use*, *History*, or *Contacts* to gather information.
* **Gather Resources:** Prepare appropriate equipment, protective measures, and backup plans.

### The Journey

#### A. Urban Investigation

## Setting Information

### Geography

The world of Loner Cthulhu spans from familiar New England towns to the most remote corners of Earth, and beyond into dimensions that defy human understanding.

**New England**: The epicenter of American Mythos activity, featuring towns like Arkham with its infamous university, the decaying seaport of Kingsport, and the shadow-haunted Dunwich. Ancient Native American sites dot the landscape, many predating human civilization.

**The Pacific**: Remote islands hide the ruins of R'lyeh and other sunken cities. Polynesian cultures preserve memories of the Old Ones in their most sacred traditions.

**Antarctica**: The Mountains of Madness conceal the ruins of an alien civilization, while ancient cities lie frozen beneath miles of ice.

**The Dreamlands**: A parallel dimension accessible through dreams, where different physical laws apply and ancient entities maintain courts of terrible majesty.

**Other Dimensions**: Countless realities exist beyond human space, home to the Outer Gods and phenomena that challenge the very concept of existence.

### Cultures & People

**Academic Communities**: Universities and research institutions often serve as focal points for Mythos investigations. Scholars may unknowingly study artifacts or texts connected to cosmic horrors.

**Occult Societies**: Secret organizations pursue forbidden knowledge through various means. Some seek power, others knowledge, and a few work to protect humanity from cosmic threats.

**Indigenous Peoples**: Native populations around the world often possess oral traditions that accurately describe Mythos entities, though their warnings are typically dismissed by modern society.

**Working Classes**: Fishermen, miners, and laborers frequently encounter Mythos phenomena but lack the education or social standing to be taken seriously when reporting their experiences.

**High Society**: Wealthy collectors and dilettantes often unknowingly acquire cursed artifacts or fund expeditions that unleash ancient horrors.

### Trade and Commerce

**Artifact Markets**: Black market dealers trade in ancient relics, forbidden books, and occult paraphernalia. Many items carry curses or attract unwanted attention.

**Academic Exchange**: Universities and libraries share resources, sometimes unknowingly spreading Mythos influence through scholarly networks.

**Shipping and Transport**: Global trade routes inadvertently transport Mythos artifacts and influences across continents, while remote locations remain accessible to those with sufficient resources.

### Art and Culture

**Literature**: Certain authors produce works that seem to channel otherworldly knowledge, creating fiction that serves as thinly veiled fact about cosmic horrors.

**Visual Arts**: Artists who encounter Mythos influences often create disturbing works that drive viewers to madness while revealing hidden truths about reality.

**Music**: Specific musical compositions can open doorways between dimensions or summon entities when performed correctly.

**Architecture**: Certain geometric patterns and architectural forms can focus cosmic energies or serve as gateways to other realities.

### Magic and Mysticism

**Ritual Magic**: True magic in the Mythos is not about casting spells, but about understanding and manipulating cosmic forces that exist beyond human comprehension. Rituals require specific components, precise timing, and often exact terrible costs from practitioners.

**Protective Wards**: Certain symbols, materials, and rituals can provide limited protection against Mythos entities, though nothing offers complete safety from cosmic horrors.

**Divination**: Various methods exist for glimpsing future events or distant locations, though the visions received are often cryptic and may drive the practitioner insane.

**Summoning**: The most dangerous form of magic involves calling entities from other dimensions. Such rituals typically require blood sacrifice and risk unleashing uncontrollable forces.

### Folklore and Mythology

**Ancient Warnings**: Folk tales from around the world contain kernels of truth about Mythos entities, disguised as myths and legends to protect the sanity of those who hear them.

**Prophetic Traditions**: Various cultures possess oral traditions that accurately predict the return of the Great Old Ones, though these prophecies are dismissed as primitive superstition by modern scholars.

**Protective Customs**: Many traditional practices—from blessing rituals to architectural taboos—actually serve to ward off Mythos influences, though their true purpose has been forgotten over time.
