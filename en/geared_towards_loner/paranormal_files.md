# **Loner: Paranormal Files**  

***Loner: Paranormal Files*** is a solo tabletop RPG adventure set in a world where secret organizations investigate, contain, and sometimes battle the unexplained. From reality-warping anomalies to cryptic artifacts and otherworldly entities, you step into the role of an investigator navigating a shadowy world of conspiracies, classified incidents, and unsettling truths.  

This minimalist Solo Role Playing Game is designed to be a **narrative-driven experience of suspense, discovery, and cosmic horror**, where you piece together fragmented evidence, confront the unknown, and determine what must remain hidden from the public.  

## **Introduction**  

***Loner: Paranormal Files*** follows the following design principles:  

1. **Portable**: To play, you will need a few common (six-sided) dice and writing materials. Anything else is optional and not essential.  
2. **Rules-Light**: The game relies on a few rules and only one resolving mechanic, easy to learn and eventually to memorize.  
3. **Tag-based**: Characters and situations are defined only by qualitative descriptors and not by quantitative characteristics.  

With a focus on quick resolutions, **Loner: Paranormal Files** throws you headfirst into the heart of the unknown. Your character will be defined by thematic tags, such as *“Cynical Field Agent,”* *“Occult Archivist,”* or *“Unorthodox Scientist.”*  

### What is a Role Playing Game (RPG)?
A role-playing game (RPG) is a type of game in which players assume the roles of fictional characters and act out their actions and decisions within a narrative or imaginary setting. The outcome of these actions and decisions is often determined by a set of rules and game mechanics, such as dice rolls or statistical attributes of the characters. Players may also collaborate to create a shared story or narrative through their characters' actions and interactions.

### What is a Solo RPG?

In a solo RPG a single player takes on the roles of one or more characters, while also simultaneously managing some elements of the game world. These games typically involve the use of a rule system and game mechanics to determine the outcome of actions taken by the player-controlled characters. 
Unlike a gamebook (such as the Fighting Fantasy, Lone Wolf, and Tunnels & Trolls series) a solo RPG is not a form of interactive, forked narrative in which outcomes are pre-determined and limited by the author's choices.

Through the interaction of player, oracle, tools, and prompts, the character's actions will build an **emergent narrative** within whose boundaries anything can be attempted, without predetermined limits.

### Safety Tools
You will play alone, but be sure to play in an environment that is comfortable for you, without overexerting yourself, and reserve the option to stop as soon as you feel uncomfortable for any reason, physical or emotional. Don't be afraid to tackle new themes, but do so in full awareness of your boundaries.

### Minimum Requirements
To play *Loner: Paranormal Files* you will need:
- **4 six sided dice** (also known as d6s): two pairs of different colors
- **Paper and writing tools**: at least a sheet of scrap paper and and pencil, but index cards or sticky notes are a fine addition
- **Character sheet**: you may use the provided sheet at the back or a simple index card.
- **Notebook**: *Loner: Paranormal Files* is not a solo journaling game, you can easily play it in the "theater of mind". But you can keep track of you game if you feel the need!

## Setting Introduction

There’s a version of the world most people get to see. It makes sense on the surface—traffic, taxes, weather forecasts, news cycles. But beneath that comfort zone, something older and stranger is always shifting. The unexplained doesn’t go away. It gets documented, classified, and buried deep.

In *Loner: Paranormal Files*, you step into the role of someone who sees what others aren’t meant to. You don’t just investigate the unknown—you navigate the politics of secrecy, the ethics of suppression, and the toll of exposure.

Not everyone makes it out intact. Some don’t come back at all.

### Core Aspects of the Setting

#### The Veil of Secrecy
Governments deny, agencies redact, and corporations spin press releases while something entirely different plays out behind sealed doors. Cover stories are scripted before questions even get asked. And the people who dig too deep? They tend to stop showing up.

Most of the public will never know how close they’ve come.

#### Anomalies, Entities, and Artifacts
Not every anomaly is hostile. Some are dormant. Some just *observe*. But all of them distort the rules we take for granted. A hallway that folds in on itself. A radio signal that rewrites memory. A statue that knows your name before you speak.

Patterns help, but they don’t always hold. And when they break, someone has to clean up the fallout.

#### Organizations and Their Agendas
There’s no single agency in charge. Instead, there’s a quiet arms race of ideas: control, disclosure, exploitation, transcendence.

- **Government bodies** neutralize and contain.
- **Private firms** reverse-engineer the impossible.
- **Occult sects** treat anomalies as scripture.
- **Leaks and whistleblowers** fight to bring it all into the open.

You won’t always know who’s right. You’ll rarely know who’s telling the truth.

#### The Cost of Knowing
The work leaves marks. Some are visible—tremors, nosebleeds, radiation scars. Others cut deeper: sleeplessness, shifting memories, the creeping doubt that your own thoughts aren’t entirely yours anymore.

No one walks away clean. Some don’t walk away at all.

### Playable Themes

Each investigation unfolds in its own way, shaped by your character’s past, their tools, and what they’re willing to risk. Some stories focus on quiet observation; others spiral into firefights, cover-ups, or things harder to name. These themes aren’t boundaries—they blur, intersect, and change as you go.

- **Scientific Investigation** — Forensics, field labs, post-incident analysis. Measuring what can’t be explained and trying to make it behave.
- **Containment & Cleanup** — Securing unstable artifacts, neutralizing threats, and making sure no one ever hears what really happened.
- **Conspiracy Unraveling** — Following the paper trail, decrypting the lies, and realizing who *really* signs the orders.
- **Horror & Survival** — When the case goes off-script and something comes for you in the dark. Sometimes you fight. Sometimes you run.
- **Occult & Esoterica** — Symbols that speak back, rituals that don’t end, and old texts written by something that remembers you.
- **Espionage & Cover-Ups** — Planting false leads, tracking rogue agents, and doing what’s necessary to keep the truth contained—even if it means crossing a line.
- **Alien Encounters** — Crashed probes, altered memories, sightings that don’t follow physics. They’re here. The question is why.
- **Time & Dimensional Breaches** — Spaces that fold in wrong, days that repeat, and encounters with your own reflection saying things you haven’t done yet.

### Timeline of the Setting

The history of anomaly research isn’t written in textbooks. It’s hidden in redacted memos, recovered field notes, and the gaps between official stories. What follows is a loose chronology of how the world quietly lost control of the unexplained.

#### Pre-History – The Ancient Watchers  
- Anomalies predate civilization. In early records, they’re mistaken for gods, spirits, or curses.  
- Across cultures, secret groups begin cataloging strange phenomena—some aim to protect the world from them. Others worship what they find.

#### 1600s – The Occult Renaissance  
- Alchemists and natural philosophers in Europe conduct secret experiments, often destroyed or seized by the Church.  
- In Asia and the Middle East, knowledge of ritual magic, ley lines, and spiritual forces is preserved quietly across generations.  
- Not all anomalies are studied—some are sealed away, others simply vanish.

#### 1800s – Industrialization and Inquiry  
- Spiritualism blends with scientific curiosity. Séances, mesmerism, and etheric theory gain traction.  
- Organizations like the Academy of Forbidden Sciences emerge, mixing research with containment.  
- The first documented government efforts to suppress unexplained phenomena appear in scattered correspondence and buried reports.

#### 1900s – The Age of Cover-Ups  
- During both World Wars, militaries weaponize the paranormal—psychic scouts, occult rituals, and experimental artifacts. Most results are inconclusive. Some are quietly erased.  
- 1947: The Roswell incident forces formal disinformation strategies. Something did crash. The official story still holds.  
- 1960s–70s: The Cold War becomes a paranormal arms race. Telepathy, remote viewing, psychic espionage—all quietly explored, often at great human cost.  
- MKUltra isn’t shut down—it mutates, fragments, and goes off the books.  
- 1980s–90s: Bureaucracy blooms. Government agencies take formal control of anomaly research. Pop culture picks up the scent, but never the truth.

#### 2000s – The Networked Unknown  
- Secrecy grows harder. Whistleblowers, hackers, and conspiracy forums create pressure.  
- Anomalous events spike in frequency and scale. Something is shifting.  
- Factions escalate. Contractors replace operatives. Experimentation ramps up. Technology and the unexplained blur together.

#### Present Day – The Breaking Point  
- Patterns collapse. Breaches open without warning. Reports pile up: looping cities, memory anomalies, impossible structures.  
- The world still *looks* normal. But it's fraying at the edges.  
- Factions scramble to contain what they no longer fully understand.  
- Some believe disclosure is inevitable. Others are preparing for war.  
- And somewhere in the noise, something is watching back.

## Characters  

In *Loner: Paranormal Files*, you are an **investigator of the unknown**, navigating a world where reality bends, secrets are buried, and the cost of knowledge is often irreversible. Whether you are a hardened field agent, an eccentric scientist, or a whistleblower seeking the truth, your role is to confront the inexplicable—sometimes to contain it, sometimes to understand it, and sometimes simply to survive.  

Every operative, researcher, or rogue investigator brings their own expertise and weaknesses to the field. Some wield advanced technology, others rely on ancient rituals, and a few have experienced anomalies firsthand—leaving them permanently changed.  

As an investigator, you will be:  

- **Unraveling classified files, cryptic transmissions, and recovered artifacts.**  
- **Tracking anomalies, rogue agents, and supernatural threats in the field.**  
- **Deciding whether to protect the public—or expose the truth at all costs.**  
- **Facing moral dilemmas, from ethical containment to lethal cover-ups.**  
- **Surviving the psychological and physical toll of dealing with forces beyond comprehension.**  

No one walks away unchanged. The deeper you go, the more you must question:  
**What is real? What is a lie? And will you recognize yourself when it's over?**  

### Everything is a Character!

In *Loner: Paranormal Files* Non-Playing Characters (NPCs), Foes, Organizations, Monsters, and even relevant objects like vehicles are characters too!

Your Protagonist is described by some fixed traits:

- **Name**: The name should be iconic and consistent with the tone and setting of the story.
- **Concept**: A concise description of the character's profession, background, and abilities. The best are adjective-name pairings, like *"Venturous Smuggler"* or *"Child Prodigy"*.
- **Skills** (x2): Abilities not necessarily character-specific but not characteristics common to all. *"Smart"* is not a skill, *"Engine Whisperer"* is.
- **Frailty**: Something that could potentially get in the way of the character, either physically, mentally, or socially.
- **Gear** (x2): Particular equipment supplied to the character in coherence with the setting. Everyday items are taken for granted and do not fall under this trait.
- **Goal**: The long-term objective.
- **Motive**: What drives the pursuit of the goal.
- **Nemesis**: A person or organization that hinders the protagonist. It can emerge during the first game sessions, it may or may or not be the direct antagonist of the story, ready to appear to make life even more difficult
- **Luck**: The measure of a character's ability to avoid ill fortune or an inauspicious outcome. It applies only in Conflicts and automatically recharges when they end. Luck starts and caps at 6.

These **traits** are described by **tags**, descriptive words or phrases that can identify anything in the game world. Even the **details** of the environment in which the action moves and **conditions** (physical or mental) of the characters are tags. 

**They are qualitative representations. They are not quantitative measures.**

## Rules

*Loner: Paranormal Files* is a minimalist Solo Role Playing Game designed to be played with only one character (the Protagonist). You'll guide them through the story that will unravel during the game, asking closed questions to an Oracle which will help you overturn your expectations.

Every now and then you will be surprised with an unexpected twist!

### Keep The Action In Motion

A game in *Loner: Paranormal Files* is a succession of scenes. 
A scene is a unit of time in which a certain action takes place in pursuit of a certain short-term goal. 

In *Loner: Paranormal Files* at each scene:
1. **Identify what you expect from the scene**. Compared to traits, goal, and motivation determine the Protagonist's action. What might be the reaction of the game world?
2. **Test your expectations**. When you are uncertain (or overconfident) about the reaction to your actions, [ask the Oracle](#consulting-the-oracle) a closed question (answer is Yes or No), considering the tags involved to determine if there is an [Advantage or Disadvantage](#advantage-and-disadvantage).
3. **Interpret the result**. Is the Oracle's answer in line with your expectations? If not, in the context in which the scene takes place, how should an answer that subverts them be considered?

This sequence will come to you naturally after some practice. Use it as a guideline the first few times.

### Consulting the Oracle

When you need to test your expectations you'll ask the Oracle a closed question.

You’ll need 2d6 in one color (**Chance Dice**), and 2d6 in another (**Risk Dice**).

To resolve a closed question, roll one **Chance Die** and one **Risk Die**:
- If the Chance Die is highest, the answer is **Yes**. 
- If the Risk Die is highest, the answer is **No**.
- If both are low (3 or less), add a **but...**. 
- If both are high (4 or more), add an **and...**.
- If both are equal, the answer is **Yes, but...**. Add a point to the **[Twist Counter](#twist-counter)**.


| Dice Value |    Chance Die > Risk Die   | Risk Die > Chance Die |
|:----------:|:--------------------------:|:---------------------:|
|  Both < 4  |         Yes, but...        |       No, but...      |
|  Both > 3  |         Yes, and...        |       No, and...      |
| Mismatched |             Yes            |           No          |
|            |                            |                       |
|    Equal   | Add 1 to the Twist Counter |                       |

### Advantage and Disadvantage

If circumstances or positive tags grant an advantage, add a **Chance Die** to the roll. Otherwise, when hindrances or negative tag cause a disadvantage, add a **Risk Die**. In both cases keep only the higher die of the added type when you check the roll.

Consider tags **intuitively and not quantitatively**, using the context of the situation at play. It is important to keep the flow of play fast and not accounting for advantages and disadvantages numerically!

### Twist Counter

The Twist Counter is a measure of the rising tension in the narrative. At the beginning is set to 0. Every time a double throw (dice are equal) happens, add 1 to the Counter. If the Counter is below three, consider the answer as "**Yes, but...**". Otherwise a **Twist** happens and resets the Counter.

Roll 2d6 and consult the following Twist Table to determine what kind of twist happens. 

| D6 |      Subject       |        Action       |
|:--:|:------------------:|:-------------------:|
|  1 |    A third party   |       Appears       |
|  2 |      The hero      | Alters the location |
|  3 |    An encounter    |    Helps the hero   |
|  4 |  A physical event  |   Hinders the hero  |
|  5 | An emotional event |   Changes the goal  |
|  6 |      An object     |    Ends the scene   |

Interpret the two-word sentence in the context of the current scene. Twists will keep the plot and events going in unexpected ways.

### Operating in the Shadows

The rules beneath reality don’t always hold. You’re not just investigating unknown phenomena—you’re navigating a shifting world where logic collides with distortion, and control is always temporary.

In *Loner: Paranormal Files*, the systems that govern play are built to reflect that instability. You’ll use structured tools—dice, tags, oracles—to push into chaotic spaces. The outcomes you shape will feel intuitive, narrative-first, and sometimes wildly unexpected.

Whether you're dealing with hostile artifacts, psychic fallout, or political interference, the mechanics are there to guide the story—not predict it.

This is a world of patterns. Fractured ones.

#### The Unknown Threshold

In this line of work, reality isn’t fixed—it flexes. Every encounter with an anomaly presses against the edges of what your mind, body, and understanding can endure.

The **Unknown Threshold** tracks how close you are to crossing that edge.

- Begin each investigation with the Threshold at **0**.  
- Whenever you **witness**, **interact with**, or **fail to contain** an anomaly, roll the Oracle.  
- Based on the result, adjust the Threshold:

| Oracle Result      | Effect Description                              | Threshold Change |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| **Yes, and...**     | You stay grounded—clarity returns.              | -1               |
| **Yes**             | You endure. The moment passes.                  | ±0               |
| **Yes, but...**     | You push through, but feel the strain.          | +1               |
| **No, but...**      | Something bends. Subtle, but real.              | +2               |
| **No**              | The anomaly leaves a mark.                      | +3               |
| **No, and...**      | The world around you fractures.                 | +4               |

> **Threshold 6:** You’ve reached the edge. Roll on the **Reality Fracture Table**. What happens next may not be reversible.

#### Reality Fracture Table

When the Unknown overwhelms the known, something gives way. Memory. Perception. Time. Maybe more. Roll 1d6:

| d6 | Reality Fracture Effect |
|----|--------------------------|
| 1  | **Echoes of the Unseen** – Distant voices whisper in your ear. You can’t tell if they’re warnings, recordings, or just your own unraveling thoughts. |
| 2  | **Dimensional Bleed** – The environment flickers. For a few seconds, it’s somewhere else entirely—and so are you. |
| 3  | **Lost Time** – You come to with no memory of what just happened. Something around you is… off. Different. Maybe watching. |
| 4  | **Cognitive Drift** – Names, faces, simple facts slip through your mind like water. You remember things that never happened. Or haven’t yet. |
| 5  | **Marked by the Unknown** – You’re no longer just an observer. An anomaly has noticed you—and may recognize you again. |
| 6  | **The Door Opens** – A breach forms. Something steps through. Or you fall in. For a moment, you aren’t in your own reality anymore. You might not come back alone. |

> 🎲 You may attempt to **stabilize** with a successful Oracle roll. But some effects leave scars even after they fade.

#### Anomaly Interaction

Every encounter with an anomaly is a risk. Some pull you in. Some push back. Some don’t care you’re there—until you make the wrong move.

Use the Oracle to determine the outcome when engaging with cryptids, artifacts, rifts, unexplained events, or anything that resists being understood.

| **Interaction Type**    | **Oracle Result**           |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Direct Contact** — Touching, activating, or stepping into the anomaly. | **Yes, and...** → You gain clear knowledge or access, unharmed.<br>**No, and...** → Severe consequence: imprinting, mutation, identity loss. |
| **Observation** — Watching from a distance, scanning, passive analysis. | **Yes, but...** → You gain insight, but something slips through—distortions, emotional bleed, echoing thoughts. |
| **Containment Attempt** — Trying to seal, disable, or control the anomaly. | **No, but...** → Containment fails, but the anomaly remains dormant—for now. You might get another shot. |
| **Suppression / Cover-Up** — Erasing evidence, redirecting blame, silencing witnesses. | **Yes, and...** → Total erasure. No leaks, no trail.<br>**No, and...** → The truth gets out. Factions notice. Someone’s coming. |
| **Mental Resistance** — Resisting hallucinations, psychic pressure, or memetic damage. | **No, but...** → You’re altered: visions, memory shifts, sensory confusion. You stay standing—but something’s changed. |

> Some anomalies adapt. Some remember. And some only exist because you're trying to observe them.

#### Cover-Ups & Information Control

In this line of work, the real threat isn’t always the anomaly—it’s who finds out about it.

Every leak, every witness, every uncontained piece of truth is a crack in the façade. And if you don’t patch it, someone else will exploit it.

When you attempt a cover-up, roll the Oracle:

- **Yes, and...** → The event is erased entirely. No memory, no evidence. It never happened.
- **Yes** → The cover-up holds. The official story sticks—but some are still asking questions.
- **Yes, but...** → The truth festers underground. Fringe forums light up. You’ll need to intervene again.
- **No, but...** → You fail to bury it—but in the process, you uncover another faction’s involvement.
- **No** → Word spreads. The story leaks into public channels. Panic, speculation, or rogue investigations follow.
- **No, and...** → It backfires. The lie becomes the fuel. Power shifts. Trust crumbles. The world sees what it wasn’t meant to.

> Cover-ups don’t end when the paperwork’s filed. Factions take sides. Agents go rogue. Sometimes the biggest lie is that you had control at all.

#### Factions & Influence

No one faces the unknown alone. Not for long.

In the world of *Loner: Paranormal Files*, shadow organizations decide how the unexplained is studied, hidden, weaponized—or worshipped. These factions have deep reach and long memories, and they don’t play nice. Allegiances shift. Promises break. Trust is rare—and temporary.

As an investigator, you hold a **Reputation Level** with each faction, ranging from **–3 (Enemy)** to **+3 (Trusted Asset)**:

- **+3** → You’re a known quantity. They offer clearance, support, and resources.  
- **0** → Neutral. They’re watching, but they’re not acting—yet.  
- **–3** → You’re marked. They might move against you, publicly or not at all.

When dealing with a faction, roll the Oracle:

- **Yes, and...** → They grant more than you asked: access, secrets, protection.
- **Yes** → They assist as requested.
- **Yes, but...** → Help comes with strings—and those strings are always tied to something bigger.
- **No, but...** → They deny you, but in doing so, they let something slip.
- **No** → Rejected. Stonewalled. Your standing with them takes a hit.
- **No, and...** → You're flagged. Surveillance begins. Assets move. They’re coming.

> Reputation isn’t just about favors. It’s about leverage. Burn one bridge too many, and you may find the only people who’ll talk to you are the ones holding a syringe.

#### Corruption & Exposure to the Paranormal

You weren’t built to witness this.

Extended contact with anomalies—whether psychic, spatial, biological, or informational—leaves its mark. The more you see, the harder it is to tell what’s part of you and what’s trying to get in.

When exposed to a severe anomaly, roll the Oracle to see how it reshapes you.

| Oracle Result | Psychological Effect | Physical Effect |
|---------------|----------------------|------------------|
| **Yes, and...** | You stay sharp. The moment passes without impact. | No visible changes. |
| **Yes** | You bury the experience—for now. But it scratches at the edge of your thoughts. | Fatigue. Nausea. Shakes. It fades. |
| **Yes, but...** | Flickers of paranoia. Unfamiliar memories. You forget something simple—again. | Minor anomalies: a glow in your veins, heightened senses, unplaceable bruises. |
| **No, but...** | Hallucinations. Recurring nightmares. Your thoughts repeat on a loop. | Nosebleeds. Static in your vision. A shiver when the room’s not cold. |
| **No** | Your reactions change. You speak before thinking. Anomalies trigger something primal. | Skin that shifts in light. Eyes that don’t reflect right. A mark that won’t wash off. |
| **No, and...** | Something’s gone—memories, words, the feeling of being real. And something else has filled the gap. | Your form begins to shift. You no longer pass for untouched. You may not pass for human. |

> This isn’t damage. It’s transformation. You don’t heal from it. You adapt—or lose the ability to care that you didn’t.

### Conflicts

A *Conflict* is any situation in which opponents clash, attacking, defending, or wearing each other down in order to win.
This applies both in a practical and metaphorical sense. 

So, a Conflict is not only limited to combat (or fighting) in the strict sense but also to competitive situations (such as contests, duels, verbal confrontations, etc.) in which two or more characters (including vehicles, of course!) compete.

Conflicts can be resolved in different ways depending on preferences and context:
1. Ask a single closed question. The Oracle's answer determines the outcome of the conflict.
2. Ask a series of closed questions to resolve current single actions.
3. Use the rules of Harm & Luck below.

Note that the Twist Counter **does not apply** to Harm & Luck. Instead, it is used regularly if the Conflict is handled with closed questions.

If the conflict is resolved by applying damage to the Luck trait, roll the dice to determine whether the protagonist causes damage to the opponent or suffers damage due to counterattack or failed defense. The rolls are player facing only.

The damage reduces the Luck of the target, whether protagonist or NPC. When the Luck runs out, the character has lost the conflict.

The final outcome depends on the context. Do you get caught? Are you seriously injured? You may even die if that fits the narrative.

| Answer      | Do you get what you want?                               | Harm    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Yes, and... | You get what you want, and something else.              | Cause 3 |
| Yes...      | You get what you want.                                  | Cause 2 |
| Yes, but... | You get what you want, but at a cost.                   | Cause 1 |
| No, but...  | You don’t get what you want, but it’s not a total loss. | Take 1  |
| No...       | You don’t get what you were after.                      | Take 2  |
| No, and...  | You don’t get what you want, and things get worse.      | Take 3  |

### Determine the mood of the next scene

At the end of the current scene sometimes you will be clear about the direction to take, other times you may need to determine the general mood of the next one. In this case roll 1d6 and consult the following table:

|  D6 |   Next Scene   |
|:---:|:--------------:|
| 1-3 | Dramatic scene |
| 4-5 |   Quiet Scene  |
|  6  |   Meanwhile…   |

- A **dramatic scene** does not break the tension of the previous scene but carries it further forward, introducing further obstacles or difficulties.
- During a **quiet scene** there is time to take a breath, to heal, to make plans for the next steps and to deepen relationships.
- A **meanwhile scene** takes place somewhere else, other than where the hero is. It cuts to villains or other plot-important characters.

### Open-Ended Question or Get Inspired

To answer an Open-Ended question, roll 1d6 once on each of the Inspiration Tables (roll at least a verb and a noun, adjectives are optional).

### When the story ends

At the end of the adventure you may add another trait to the character. It is better that this is related to how the story just ended and can be either a Skill, Gear, a new Frailty, or even a new Nemesis! You can also modify an existing trait to better represent an enhanced expertise.

Also update the list of **NPCs**, **Locations**, and **Events** that may show up again in future adventures.

## Known Unknowns

You live in a world shaped by forces most people never notice—and wouldn’t survive if they did.

The systems of society still run: elections, schools, streaming services, rush hour. But below that surface, something else is operating. Anomalies don’t just exist—they’re being cataloged, contained, exploited. Or worse: ignored until it's too late.

Information is currency. But it’s also a weapon. Every recovered file, decrypted signal, or field report could tip the balance between understanding and obliteration.

> You don’t get to know everything. But you get to know *enough*. Enough to be dangerous. Enough to see how far the cracks go. Enough to wonder if the world you’re protecting still exists the way you remember it.

### Forbidden Coordinates

Some places don’t belong on maps.

They shift, loop, observe, and sometimes consume. These locations—known as **Anomalous Zones**—don’t just break physical laws. They erode memory, perception, and identity. Some are studied. Some are sealed. A few are left alone entirely—not by choice, but by necessity.

#### Examples of Anomalous Zones:

- **Redacted Cities** — Entire urban grids stuck in recursive loops. Residents repeat scripts. Buildings appear overnight. Satellite imagery fails to update.
- **The Veil Corridors** — A tunnel network beneath multiple continents. Enter in Siberia, exit in Nevada. No one built it. No one patrols it. No one can fully map it.
- **The Hollow Prison** — A defunct black site. Inmates vanish mid-interrogation, leaving jumpsuits behind. Last recordings end in static—always the same frequency.
- **The Horizon Event** — A stretch of highway where time folds. Take the same exit three times, end up in a different decade. Sometimes, not your own.
- **Abandoned Research Facilities** — Former labs sealed with concrete and policy. Reports persist of static whispers, rearranged furniture, and unlocked vaults.

> Some sites are too dangerous to contain. Others are active testing grounds. A few are still watching the teams sent to erase them.

### Shadow Actors

The world isn’t run by governments. It’s run by the people who know what governments won’t admit.

These are the factions fighting to control the narrative—classify it, weaponize it, sanctify it, or burn it all down. Some wear suits. Some wear masks. All of them are dangerous.

#### Major Organizations

- **Government Paranormal Divisions** — Cold bureaucracies tasked with studying and silencing the unexplainable. Funded through black budgets, hidden beneath acronyms. They don’t ask questions—they issue containment protocols.
- **Private Research Firms** — Corporations chasing patents from the beyond. They dismantle anomalies in labs, rebrand the wreckage, and sell it to defense contractors or private buyers. Ethics optional.
- **Occult Societies** — Fragmented sects that believe anomalies are sacred. Some seek communion. Others seek ascension. A few just want to watch the veil tear.
- **Insurgent Leakers** — Whistleblowers, black hats, and burnouts who want the truth out in the open. They release classified data knowing it might kill them—or everyone else.
- **Independent Hunters** — Ex-agents, conspiracy podcasters, trauma survivors. No clearance. No backup. Just obsession and a few borrowed tools.

#### Ongoing Conflicts

- **Secrecy vs. Exposure** — Should anomalies be hidden to protect humanity—or revealed so it can adapt?
- **Control vs. Chaos** — Can the unknown be contained, or does every experiment just add fuel to the fire?
- **Loyalty vs. Survival** — When a handler vanishes, or a file leaks, who do you protect—your mission, your mind, or yourself?

> In this world, everyone has an agenda. Some call it protocol. Some call it prophecy. Either way, the only thing they have in common is you.

### Suppressed History & Forbidden Knowledge

What you know about the past is curated. Sanitized. Filed under convenient lies.

The real history of anomaly contact is buried under layers of disinformation, ghost files, and burn notices. You won’t find it in archives—you’ll find it in unstable data, whispered recollections, and sites where reality still hasn’t fully healed.

- **Ancient Anomalies** — Entire civilizations may have vanished after contact. The ruins don’t match the timeline. Some still emit signals.
- **The Cold War Paranormal Arms Race** — Both sides ran psychic warfare ops, built devices that listened to the dead, and opened things no one could close. The few survivors don’t talk. The labs were never officially there.
- **The Roswell Deception** — A weather balloon, they said. The object’s core is still sealed beneath desert stone, and it still hums when the sky’s wrong.
- **MKUltra Never Ended** — The programs changed names. The research continued. Some of the subjects now work in containment. Some don’t know they’re still active.
- **Timeline Contamination** — Recovered blueprints that shouldn’t exist. Photos taken decades before the camera that took them was invented. Human bones found with synthetic implants that haven’t been built yet.

This isn’t forgotten knowledge—it’s knowledge that changes you the moment you understand it. Some files are redacted not to protect secrets, but to keep the reader intact.

### Anomalies, Entities & Unexplained Phenomena

Anomalies don’t follow rules—they rewrite them.

Some can be classified. Monitored. Contained, if you’re lucky. Others shift the moment they’re observed, adapting to perception, resisting logic, or leaking into the minds of anyone who gets too close.

Field protocols categorize anomalies by behavior, not origin. But most investigators know better—**nothing stays in one category for long.**

#### Common Classifications

- **Cognitohazards** — Concepts, symbols, or signals that harm simply by being understood. Exposure symptoms range from obsession to psychological collapse.
- **Temporal Distortions** — Locations or items that fragment chronology. Time loops, pre-echoes, and erased hours are common side effects.
- **Possessed Objects** — Items with agency. Some are predators. Some play dead. A few only act when no one’s watching.
- **Biological Mutations** — Lifeforms with anatomy that shouldn’t function—and does. Many possess psychic traits or regenerative behavior that defies physics.
- **Extraterrestrial Contact** — Not aliens. Not exactly. These entities don’t follow our rules of space, identity, or sequence. Some may not recognize us as separate beings.
- **Eldritch Constructs** — Architectures that shouldn't exist in three-dimensional space. Some observe. Some respond. A few restructure thought on entry.

#### Encounter Protocols

- Some anomalies are dormant. Others are hostile. Most fall somewhere in between—until you try to interfere.
- **Neutralization is rare**. Some anomalies can’t be destroyed—only isolated, buried, or erased from memory.
- **Adaptive anomalies** grow more dangerous with each interaction. Every repeat encounter increases the risk.

> If you’ve seen an anomaly once, and walked away? Don’t count on walking away again. Reality doesn’t like being studied.

### Cover-Ups, Misinformation & The Public

The most dangerous anomaly is the one everyone believes is real.

Disinformation isn’t a byproduct—it’s policy. Agencies flood the airwaves with staged sightings, planted witnesses, and "leaks" designed to discredit themselves. The goal isn’t to hide the truth. It’s to make sure no one would believe it even if they saw it.

- **UFO hoaxes, cryptid clickbait, false flag events**—all manufactured to bury the real incident beneath layers of absurdity.
- **Eyewitnesses are handled**—some bought out, some discredited, some quietly erased.
- **Discrediting the truth** is more effective than hiding it. Fabricated leaks spread faster than facts—and they're easier to control.
- **Whistleblowers vanish**—sometimes mid-upload, sometimes before they even realize what they’ve uncovered.
- **Mass hysteria is weaponized**. A staged panic in the right city can wipe three real anomalies from public consciousness overnight.

And the most disturbing part?

> Most people don’t want the truth. They want the version that helps them sleep.

Sometimes the anomaly doesn’t kill you.  
The cleanup team does.

### Experimental Technology & Paranormal Science

When reality stops making sense, science doesn’t stop—it mutates.

Across black-budget labs, abandoned facilities, and rogue research cells, humanity has developed tools to stabilize the unstable, suppress the unspeakable, or twist the impossible to its advantage. None of it’s safe. All of it’s unfinished.

#### Classified Prototypes & Forbidden Tech

- **Anomaly Field Disruptors** — Disables active anomalies within a limited radius. Sometimes. Other times, it makes them more aware.
- **Neural Firewall Implants** — Blocks cognitohazards and intrusive signals. Known side effects: memory erasure, personality bleed, recursive thought loops.
- **Dimensional Anchors** — Stabilizes local spacetime. If overused, can trap the user in a split timeline or delay their return indefinitely.
- **Bio-Signal Augmenters** — Tracks psychic frequencies across anomalous zones. Prolonged use may align the user’s mind with nonhuman thought patterns.
- **Rewritten DNA Strains** — Gene therapy to resist anomaly infection. Subjects report changes in sensory processing, empathy reduction, and dreams not their own.

> Every breakthrough costs something—sanity, humanity, continuity. Most researchers don’t ask if the tools work. They ask if the user is still recognizable when they’re done.

Sometimes the tech wins.  
Sometimes the anomaly learns from it.

## Factions

### The Black Sigil  
- **Concept**: Covert Occultists  
- **Skills**: Ritual Engineering, Anomaly Binding  
- **Frailty**: Bound by Ancient Pacts  
- **Gear**: Sealed Grimoire, Reality-Warping Insignia  
- **Goal**: To master anomalies as tools of influence and control.  
- **Motive**: They see no boundary between science and sorcery.  
- **Nemesis**: The Sentinels of the Veil  

The Black Sigil operates where ritual intersects with research. Born from fractured covens, ex-government parascience units, and power-hungry scholars, they believe anomalies aren’t threats—they’re assets.  

They reverse-engineer rituals like weapons tech, maintain black-market artifact rings, and embed agents inside corporate labs. Their rituals work—usually. But their oldest contracts are written in forgotten languages, and some of the entities bound by them have started remembering.

### The Sentinels of the Veil  
- **Concept**: Unyielding Protectors  
- **Skills**: Suppression Protocols, Surveillance Operations  
- **Frailty**: Rigid Dogma  
- **Gear**: Signal-Jamming Field Generator, Subdermal Tracker Implants  
- **Goal**: To erase all public knowledge of the paranormal.  
- **Motive**: They believe ignorance is humanity’s best defense.  
- **Nemesis**: The Horizon Initiative  

The Sentinels act without hesitation. Their job is to contain breaches, eliminate leaks, and maintain the illusion of normalcy—by any means. Operating across military channels and black-budget ops, they redact reality as if it were policy.  

They're efficient. Precise. Feared. But their command structure hasn’t changed in decades, and younger agents have started asking questions they’re not supposed to.

### The Horizon Initiative  
- **Concept**: Idealistic Researchers  
- **Skills**: Controlled Exposure, Technological Integration  
- **Frailty**: Undermined and Underfunded  
- **Gear**: Neural Shield Prototype, Anomaly Response Scanner  
- **Goal**: To responsibly disclose and study anomalies for public benefit.  
- **Motive**: They believe secrecy is unsustainable—and dangerous.  
- **Nemesis**: The Sentinels of the Veil  

The Horizon Initiative was formed by whistleblowers, fringe academics, and defectors from places best not named. They believe suppression only makes things worse—and that controlled understanding is the only way forward.  

They build psychic dampeners, leak limited truths, and study anomalies under lab conditions. But their optimism puts targets on their backs, and their data gets stolen as fast as they can collect it.

### The Hollow Sun  
- **Concept**: Apocalyptic Cultists  
- **Skills**: Indoctrination, Entropic Resonance  
- **Frailty**: Prophecy Obsession  
- **Gear**: Cryptic Cosmic Map, Sacrificial Blade  
- **Goal**: To usher in a post-human paradigm through anomaly exposure.  
- **Motive**: They believe the veil must tear—for evolution to begin.  
- **Nemesis**: Everyone  

The Hollow Sun doesn’t want to contain the unknown—they want to *become* it. They see anomalies as catalysts for transformation, not contamination. Some believe enlightenment lies beyond reality. Others just want to watch the world burn through a different lens.  

They appear in underground forums, biotech startups, cult gatherings, and funding boards. Some of them aren’t fully people anymore. Some never were.

### The Phantom Division  
- **Concept**: Ghosts in the System  
- **Skills**: Cyber Infiltration, Data Corruption  
- **Frailty**: Fragmented Leadership  
- **Gear**: Encrypted Relay Node, Cognitive Backups  
- **Goal**: To expose and dismantle monopoly over anomalous knowledge.  
- **Motive**: No one should own the truth.  
- **Nemesis**: The Sentinels of the Veil  

The Phantom Division isn’t a faction—it’s a network. Comprised of disavowed agents, rogue AI constructs, and glitching mind-copies, they operate across the dark net and hardware black zones. They breach secure servers like ghosts through walls.

They leak redacted ops footage. They seed false anomalies. They sabotage control systems. But without a central command, no one knows who speaks for them—or if anyone does.

### The Lazarus Accord  
- **Concept**: Resurrected Operatives  
- **Skills**: Paranormal Adaptation, Tactical Recovery  
- **Frailty**: Unstable Existences  
- **Gear**: Self-Regenerating Armor, Reanimation Serum  
- **Goal**: To control their origins—and rewrite their fate.  
- **Motive**: They believe they’re no longer human—and that’s a strength.  
- **Nemesis**: Anyone who wants them classified, caged, or erased  

The Lazarus Accord is what’s left after failed experiments, haunted operations, and black site abandonments. Agents who should be dead. Subjects who escaped the lab. Operatives brought back wrong.  

They live in forgotten safehouses, off-grid ghost towns, and sewers under research campuses. They’re immune to most anomalies. But not to each other.

| 12  | Surveillance intel is incomplete—the target agency’s internal layout changes weekly and has no elevators, yet staff appear on all floors. |
| 13  | Your handler insists you never speak to Agent Morris. He’s been missing for five years—but shows up daily at the rival HQ. |

| 45  | An anomaly is being contained in plain sight—none of the staff acknowledge it, but you can feel its eyes when no one else is around. |
| 46  | You’re issued a desk in a room with mirrors on all walls. Every reflection lags behind a little more each day. |
| 51  | Your access logs begin showing locations you’ve never visited—and times you weren’t present. Security doesn’t question it. |
| 52  | You’re handed a document marked “Eyes Only: Field Infiltrator”—your alias is listed as the author. |

| 56  | Colleagues begin repeating the phrase “as it was written” whenever you ask basic questions. |
| 61  | You overhear your own voice giving orders on the internal comms. You never remember saying any of it. |
| 62  | You’re invited to a meeting that isn’t on your schedule—everyone there is wearing your face. |
| 63  | A hallway seems to erase part of your memory each time you walk down it. Others notice—but say nothing. |
| 64  | An emergency drill requires staff to wear hoods with no eyeholes. When you do, you see something no one else can. |
| 65  | You find a journal in your locker—entries are written in your handwriting, detailing sabotage you haven’t done yet. |
| 66  | When you try to exit, the lobby security stops you: “You’ve only just arrived, Agent.” You’ve been embedded for seven months. |
